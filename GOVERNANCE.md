# Governance of `elastix` #

The elastix project is still under governance and supervision of the original lead developers Marius Staring and Stefan Klein.

Nowadays many subprojects of elastix exist and the supervision of these projects is also in hands of several other developers/scientists.
The subprojects and their main other supervisors are:

  * `elastix`: Niels Dekker
  * `elastix model zoo`: Viktor van der Valk
  * `elastix_napari`: Viktor van der Valk
  * `elastix docker image`: Viktor van der Valk
  * `SimpleElastix`: Kasper Marstal
  * `ITKElastix`: Matt McCormick, Dženan Zukić
