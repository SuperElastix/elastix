\chapter{Introduction}\label{chp:Introduction}

This manual describes a software package for image registration:
\elastix. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that
are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. A
large part of the code is based on the Insight Toolkit (ITK). The
modular design of \elastix\ allows users to quickly test and
compare different registration methods for their specific
applications. The command-line interface simplifies the processing
of large amounts of data sets, using scripting.

\section{Outline of this manual}

In Chapter~\ref{chp:Registration} quite an extensive introduction to
some general theory of image registration is given. Also, the
different components of which a registration method consists, are
treated. In Chapter~\ref{chp:elastix}, \elastix\ is described and
its usage is explained. Chapter~\ref{chp:transformix} is dedicated
to \transformix, a program accompanying \elastix. A tutorial is
given in Chapter~\ref{chp:Tutorial}, including many recommendations
based on the authors' experiences. More advanced registration topics
are covered in Chapter \ref{chp:advanced}. The final chapter
provides more details for those interested in the setup of the
source code, gives information on how to implement your own
additions to \elastix, and describes the use of \elastix\ as a
library instead of a command line program. In the Appendices
\ref{chp:ExampleParam} and \ref{chp:ExampleTransformParam} example
(transform) parameter files are given. Appendix \ref{chp:License}
contains the software license and disclaimer under which \elastix\
is currently distributed.

%Chapter~\ref{chp:develop} provides more details about the source code
%and explains how to create extensions of \elastix.

\chapter{Image registration}\label{chp:Registration}

This chapter introduces primary registration concepts that are at
the base of \elastix. More advanced registration topics are covered
in Chapter \ref{chp:advanced}.

Image registration is an important tool in the field of medical
imaging. In many clinical situations several images of a patient are
made in order to analyse the patient's situation. These images are
acquired with, for example, X-ray scanners, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) scanners, Computed Tomography (CT) scanners, and
Ultrasound scanners, which provide knowledge about the anatomy of
the subject. Combination of patient data, mono- or multi-modal,
often yields additional clinical information not apparent in the
separate images. For this purpose, the spatial relation between the
images has to be found. Image registration is the task of finding a
spatial one-to-one mapping from voxels in one image to voxels in the
other image, see Figure \ref{fig:concept}. Good reviews on the
subject are given in
\citet{MaintzEA98,LesterEA99,HillEA01,Hajnal01,Zit03:Image,
Modersitzki04:Numerical}, and more recently \cite{Sotiras2013}.

The following section introduces the mathematical formulation of
the registration process and gives an overview of the components
of which a general registration method consists. After that, in
Sections~\ref{sec:comp:metric}-\ref{sec:comp:multiresolution},
each component is discussed in more detail. For each component,
the name used by \elastix\ is given, in \texttt{typewriter} style.
In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}, methods to evaluate the
registration results are discussed.

\section{Registration framework}\label{sec:framework}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{ImageRegistrationConcept.eps}
\caption{Image registration is the task of finding a spatial
transformation mapping one image to another. Left is the fixed image
and right the moving image. Adopted from
\citet{ITKSoftwareGuideSecondEdition}.} \label{fig:concept}
\end{figure}

Two images are involved in the registration process. One image, the
\emph{moving image} $I_M(\vx)$, is deformed to fit the other image,
the \emph{fixed image} $I_F(\vx)$. The fixed and moving image are of
dimension $d$ and are each defined on their own spatial domain:
$\Omega_F \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $\Omega_M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$,
respectively. Registration is the problem of finding a
\emph{displacement} $\vux$ that makes $I_M(\vx + \vux)$ spatially
aligned to $I_F(\vx)$. An equivalent formulation is to say that
registration is the problem of finding a \emph{transformation}
$\vT(\vx) = \vx + \vux $ that makes $I_M(\vT(\vx))$ spatially
aligned to $I_F(\vx)$. The transformation is defined as a mapping
from the fixed image to the moving image, i.e. $\vT: \Omega_F
\subset \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \Omega_M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. The
quality of alignment is defined by a distance or similarity measure
$\Sim$, such as the sum of squared differences (SSD), the
correlation ratio, or the mutual information (MI) measure. Because
this problem is ill-posed for nonrigid transformations $\vT$, a
regularisation or penalty term $\Pen$ is often introduced that
constrains $\vT$.

Commonly, the registration problem is formulated as an optimisation
problem in which the cost function $\mathcal{C}$ is minimised w.r.t.
$\vT$:
\begin{align}
\hat \vT &= \arg \min_{\vT} \CC (\vT; I_F,I_M), \qquad \text{with} \label{eq:registration1}\\
\CC(\vT; I_F,I_M) &= -\Sim(\vT; I_F,I_M) + \gamma
\Pen(\vT),\label{eq:registration2}
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ weighs similarity against regularity. To solve the above
minimisation problem, there are basically two approaches: parametric and
nonparametric. The reader is referred to \cite{Fis04:Unified} for an overview
on nonparametric methods, which are not discussed in this manual. The \elastix\
software is based on the parametric approach. In parametric methods, the number
of possible transformations is limited by introducing a parametrisation (model)
of the transformation. The original optimisation problem thus becomes:
\begin{align}
\hat\vTm &= \arg \min_{\vTm}
 \CC(\vTm ; I_F,I_M), \label{eq:towardsparametric}
\end{align}
where the subscript $\vmu$ indicates that the transform has been
parameterised. The vector $\vmu$ contains the values of the
``transformation parameters''. For example, when the
transformation is modelled as a 2D rigid transformation, the
parameter vector $\vmu$ contains one rotation angle and the
translations in $x$ and $y$ direction. We may write Equation
(\ref{eq:towardsparametric}) also as:
\begin{align}
\hat\vmu &= \arg \min_{\vmu} \CC(\vmu; I_F,I_M).
\label{eq:parametric}
\end{align}
From this equation it becomes clear that the original problem
(\ref{eq:registration1}) has been simplified. Instead of optimising
over a ``space of functions $\vT$'', we now optimise over the
elements of $\vmu$. Examples of other transformation models are given
in Section~\ref{sec:comp:transform}.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/registrationcomponents.eps}
\caption{The basic registration components.}
\label{fig:registrationcomponents}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:registrationcomponents} shows the general components
of a parametric registration algorithm in a block scheme. The scheme
is a slightly extended version of the scheme introduced in
\cite{ITKSoftwareGuideSecondEdition}. Several components can be
recognised from Equations
(\ref{eq:registration1})-(\ref{eq:parametric}); some will be
introduced later. First of all, we have the images. The concept of
an image needs to be defined. This is done in
Section~\ref{sec:comp:image}. Then we have the cost function $\CC$,
or ``metric'', which defines the quality of alignment. As mentioned
earlier, the cost function consists of a similarity measure $\Sim$
and a regularisation term $\Pen$. The regularisation term $\Pen$ is
not discussed in this chapter, but in Chapter \ref{chp:advanced}.
The similarity measure $\Sim$ is discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:comp:metric}. The definition of the similarity
measure introduces the sampler component, which is treated in
Section~\ref{sec:comp:sampler}. Some examples of transformation
models $\vT_{\vmu}$ are given in Section~\ref{sec:comp:transform}.
The optimisation procedure to actually solve the problem
(\ref{eq:parametric}) is explained in Section
\ref{sec:comp:optimiser}. During the optimisation, the value
$I_M(\vT_{\vmu}(\vx))$ is evaluated at non-voxel positions, for
which intensity interpolation is needed. Choices for the
interpolator are described in Section \ref{sec:comp:interpolator}.
Another thing, not immediately clear from Equations
(\ref{eq:registration1})-(\ref{eq:parametric}), is the use of
multi-resolution strategies to speed-up registration, and to make it
more robust, see Section \ref{sec:comp:multiresolution}.

\section{Images}\label{sec:comp:image}

Since image registration is all about images, we have to be
careful with what is meant by an image. We adopt the notion of an
image from the Insight Toolkit \citep[p.
40]{ITKSoftwareGuideSecondEdition}:

\begin{quote}
Additional information about the images is considered mandatory.
In particular the information associated with the physical spacing
between pixels and the position of the image in space with respect
to some world coordinate system are extremely important. Image
origin and spacing are fundamental to many applications.
Registration, for example, is performed in physical coordinates.
Improperly defined spacing and origins will result in inconsistent
results in such processes. Medical images with no spatial
information should not be used for medical diagnosis, image
analysis, feature extraction, assisted radiation therapy or image
guided surgery. In other words, medical images lacking spatial
information are not only useless but also hazardous.

Figure \ref{fig:image} illustrates the main geometrical concepts
associated with the itk::Image. In this figure, circles are used
to represent the centre of pixels. The value of the pixel is
assumed to exist as a Dirac Delta Function located at the pixel
centre. Pixel spacing is measured between the pixel centres and
can be different along each dimension. The image origin is
associated with the coordinates of the first pixel in the image. A
pixel is considered to be the rectangular region surrounding the
pixel centre holding the data value. This can be viewed as the
Voronoi region of the image grid, as illustrated in the right side
of the figure. Linear interpolation of image values is performed
inside the Delaunay region whose corners are pixel centres.
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{ImageOriginAndSpacing.eps}
\caption{Geometrical concepts associated with the ITK image.
Adopted from \citet{ITKSoftwareGuideSecondEdition}.}
\label{fig:image}
\end{figure}

Therefore, you should take care that you use an image format that is
able to store the relevant information (e.g. \texttt{mhd}, DICOM).
Some image formats, like \texttt{bmp}, do not store the origin and
spacing. This may cause serious problems! Note that \elastix\
supports all file formats that are supported by the ITK
(\url{https://itk.org/Wiki/ITK/File_Formats}).

Up to \elastix\ version 4.2, the image orientation (direction cosines) was not
yet fully supported in \elastix. From \elastix\ 4.3, image orientation is fully
supported, but can be disabled for backward compatibility reasons.

\section{Metrics}\label{sec:comp:metric}

Several choices for the similarity measure can be found in the
literature. Some common choices are described below. Between brackets
the name of the metric in \elastix\ is given:

\begin{description}
\item[Mean Squared Difference (MSD):] (\texttt{AdvancedMeanSquares})
The MSD is defined as:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{MSD}(\vmu;I_F,I_M) &= \frac{1}{|\Omega_F|}
\sum\limits_{\vx_i \in \Omega_F} \left( I_F(\vx_i) -
I_M(\vT_{\vmu}(\vx_i)) \right)^2,\label{eq:ssd}
\end{align}
with $\Omega_F$ the domain of the fixed image $I_F$, and
$|\Omega_F|$ the number of voxels. Given a transformation $\vT$,
this measure can easily be implemented by looping over the voxels
in the fixed image, taking $I_F(\vx_i)$, calculating
$I_M(\vT_{\vmu}(\vx_i))$ by interpolation, and adding the squared
difference to the sum.

\item[Normalised Correlation Coefficient (NCC):]
(\texttt{AdvancedNormalizedCorrelation}) The NCC is defined as:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{NCC}(\vmu;I_F,I_M) &= \frac{ \sum\limits_{\vx_i \in \Omega_F}
\left( I_F(\vx_i) - \overline{I_F} \right) \left( I_M(\vTm(\vx_i)) -
\overline{I_M} \right) }{ \sqrt{\sum\limits_{\vx_i \in \Omega_F}
\left( I_F(\vx_i) - \overline{I_F} \right)^2 \sum\limits_{\vx_i \in
\Omega_F} \left( I_M(\vTm(\vx_i)) - \overline{I_M} \right)^2}
},\label{eq:ncc}
\end{align}
with the average grey-values
$\overline{I_F}=\frac{1}{|\Omega_F|}\sum\limits_{\vx_i \in
\Omega_F} I_F(\vx_i)$ and
$\overline{I_M}=\frac{1}{|\Omega_F|}\sum\limits_{\vx_i \in
\Omega_F} I_M(\vT_{\vmu}(\vx_i))$.

\item[Mutual Information (MI):] (\texttt{AdvancedMattesMutualInformation})
For MI \citep{MaesEA97,ViolaEA97,MattesEA03} we use a definition
given by \citet{ThevenazEA00a}:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{MI}(\vmu; I_F, I_M) &=
 \sum\limits_{m\in L_M} \sum\limits_{f\in L_F}
 p(f,m;\vmu) \log_2
 \left( \frac{ p(f,m;\vmu) }{ p_F(f) p_M(m;\vmu)  }
 \right),\label{eq:MI}
\end{align}
where $L_F$ and $L_M$ are sets of regularly spaced intensity bin
centres, $p$ is the discrete joint probability, and $p_F$ and
$p_M$ are the marginal discrete probabilities of the fixed and
moving image, obtained by summing $p$ over $m$ and $f$,
respectively. The joint probabilities are estimated using B-spline
Parzen windows:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
 p(f,m;\vmu) &=  \frac{1}{|\Omega_F|} \sum\limits_{\vx_i \in \Omega_F}
 w_F( f/\sigma_F - I_F(\vx_i)/\sigma_F ) \\
 &\relphantom{=}\times w_M( m/\sigma_M - I_M(\vTm(\vx_i))/\sigma_M ),
\end{split} \label{eq:histogram}
\end{align}
where $w_F$ and $w_M$ represent the fixed and moving B-spline
Parzen windows. The scaling constants $\sigma_F$ and $\sigma_M$
must equal the intensity bin widths defined by $L_F$ and $L_M$.
These follow directly from the grey-value ranges of $I_F$ and
$I_M$ and the user-specified number of histogram bins $|L_F|$ and
$|L_M|$.

\item[Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):]
(\texttt{NormalizedMutualInformation})\\ NMI is defined by
$\mathrm{NMI} = ( H(I_F) + H(I_M) ) / H(I_F,I_M)$, with $H$
denoting entropy. This expression can be compared to the
definition of MI in terms of $H$: $\mathrm{MI} = H(I_F) + H(I_M) -
H(I_F,I_M)$. Again, with the joint probabilities defined by
\ref{eq:histogram} (using B-spline Parzen windows), NMI can be
written as:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{NMI}(\vmu; I_F, I_M) &=
 \frac{\sum\limits_{f\in L_F} p_F(f)
 \log_2 p_F(f) + \sum\limits_{m\in L_M} p_M(m;\vmu) \log_2 p_M(m;\vmu)}
 { \sum\limits_{m\in L_M} \sum\limits_{f\in L_F}
 p(f,m;\vmu) \log_2 p(f,m;\vmu)} \nonumber \\ \nonumber \\
 &= \frac{\sum\limits_{m\in L_M} \sum\limits_{f\in L_F} p(f,m;\vmu) \log_2
 \left( p_F(f) p_M(m;\vmu) \right)}{ \sum\limits_{m\in L_M} \sum\limits_{f\in L_F}
 p(f,m;\vmu) \log_2 p(f,m;\vmu) }. \label{eq:NMI}
\end{align}

\item[Kappa Statistic (KS):] (\texttt{AdvancedKappaStatistic})
KS is defined as:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{KS}(\vmu;I_F,I_M) &= \frac{ 2 \sum\limits_{\vx_i \in
\Omega_F} \mathbf{1}_{I_F(\vx_i) = f, I_M(\vT_{\vmu}(\vx_i)) =
f}}{\sum\limits_{\vx_i \in \Omega_F} \mathbf{1}_{I_F(\vx_i) = f} +
\mathbf{1}_{I_M(\vT_{\vmu}(\vx_i)) = f}}, \label{eq:KS}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function, and $f$ a user-defined
foreground value that defaults to 1.

\end{description}

The MSD measure is a measure that is only suited for two images with
an equal intensity distribution, i.e. for images from the same
modality. NCC is less strict, it assumes a linear relation between
the intensity values of the fixed and moving image, and can
therefore be used more often. The MI measure is even more general:
only a relation between the probability distributions of the
intensities of the fixed and moving image is assumed. For MI it is
well-known that it is suited not only for mono-modal, but also for
multi-modal image pairs. This measure is often a good choice for
image registration. The NMI measure is, just like MI, suitable for
mono- and multi-modality registration. \cite{Stu99:NMI} seems to
indicate better performance than MI in some cases. (Note that in
\elastix\ we optimized MI for performance, which we did not do for
NMI.) The KS measure is specifically meant to register binary images
(segmentations). It measures the ``overlap'' of the segmentations.

\section{Image samplers}\label{sec:comp:sampler}

In Equations (\ref{eq:ssd})-(\ref{eq:histogram}) we observe a loop
over the fixed image: $\sum_{\vx_i \in \Omega_F}$. Until now, we
assumed that the loop goes over \emph{all} voxels of the fixed
image. In general, this is not necessary. A subset may suffice
\citep{ThevenazEA00a,KleinEA07}. The subset may be selected in
different ways: random, on a grid, etc. The sampler component
represents this process.

The following samplers are often used:
\begin{description}
\item[Full:] (\texttt{Full}) A full sampler simply selects all voxel coordinates $\vx_i$ of the
fixed image.

\item[Grid:] (\texttt{Grid}) The grid sampler defines a regular grid on the fixed
image and selects the coordinates $\vx_i$ on the grid. Effectively,
the grid sampler thus downsamples the fixed image (not preceded by
smoothing). The size of the grid (or equivalently, the downsampling
factor, which is the original fixed image size divided by the grid
size) is a user input.

\item[Random:] (\texttt{Random}) A random sampler randomly selects a user-specified number of
voxels from the fixed image, whose coordinates form $\vx_i$. Every
voxel has equal chance to be selected. A sample is not necessarily
selected only once.

\item[Random Coordinate:] (\texttt{RandomCoordinate}) A random coordinate sampler is similar
to a random sampler. It also randomly selects a user-specified number
of coordinates $\vx_i$. However, the random coordinate sampler is not
limited to voxel positions. Coordinates \emph{between} voxels can
also be selected. The grey-value $I_F(\vx_i)$ at those locations must
of course be obtained by interpolation.

\end{description}

While at first sight the full sampler seems the most obvious
choice, in practice it is not always used, because of its
computational costs in large images. The random samplers are
especially useful in combination with a stochastic optimisation
method \citep{KleinEA07}. See also
Section~\ref{sec:comp:optimiser}. The use of the random coordinate
sampler makes the cost function $\CC$ a more smooth function of
$\vmu$, which makes the optimisation problem (\ref{eq:parametric})
easier to solve. This has been shown in \cite{The08:Halton}.

\section{Interpolators}\label{sec:comp:interpolator}

As stated previously, during the optimisation the value $I_M(\vTmx)$
is evaluated at non-voxel positions, for which intensity
interpolation is needed. Several methods for interpolation exist,
varying in quality and speed. Some examples are given in Figure
\ref{fig:interpolation}.

\begin{description}
\item[Nearest neighbour:] (\texttt{NearestNeighborInterpolator}) This is the most simple technique, low in
quality, requiring little resources. The intensity of the voxel
nearest in distance is returned.

\item[Linear:] (\texttt{LinearInterpolator}) The returned value is a weighted
average of the surrounding voxels, with the distance to each voxel
taken as weight.

\item[$N$-th order B-spline:] (\texttt{BSplineInterpolator} or
\texttt{BSplineInterpolatorFloat} for a memory efficient version)
The higher the order, the better the quality, but also requiring
more computation time. In fact, nearest neighbour ($N=0$) and
linear interpolation ($N=1$) also fall in this category. See
\citet{Unser99} for more details.
\end{description}

During registration a first-order B-spline interpolation, i.e. linear
interpolation, often gives satisfactory results. It is a good
trade-off between quality and speed. To generate the final result,
i.e. the deformed result of the registration, a higher-order
interpolation is usually required, for which we recommend $N=3$. The
final result is generated in \elastix\ by a so-called
\texttt{ResampleInterpolator}. Any one of the above can be used, but
you need to prepend the name with \texttt{Final}, for example:
\texttt{FinalLinearInterpolator}.

B-spline $N=2$, (d) B-spline $N=3$, (e) B-spline $N=5$.}
\label{fig:interpolation}
\end{figure}

\section{Transforms}\label{sec:comp:transform}

A frequent confusion about the transformation is its direction. In \elastix\
the transformation is defined as a \textbf{coordinate mapping from the fixed
image domain to the moving image domain}: $\vT: \Omega_F \subset \mathbb{R}^d
\rightarrow \Omega_M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. The confusion usually stems from
the phrase: ``the moving image is deformed to fit the fixed image''. Although
one can speak about image registration like this, such a phrase is not meant to
reflect mathematical underlyings: one deforms the moving image, but the
transformation is still defined from fixed to moving image. The reason for this
becomes clear when trying to compute the deformed moving image (the
registration result) $I_M(\vTmx)$ (this process is frequently called
\emph{resampling}). If the transformation would be defined from moving to fixed
image, not all voxels in the fixed image domain would be mapped to (e.g. in
case of a scaling), and holes would occur in the deformed moving image. With
the transformation defined as it is, resampling is quite simple: loop over all
voxels $\vx$ in the fixed image domain $\Omega_F$, compute its mapped position
$\bm{y} = \vTmx$, interpolate the moving image at $\bm{y}$, and fill in this
value at $\vx$ in the output image.

The transformation model used for $\vT_{\vmu}$ determines what type of
deformations between the fixed and moving image you can handle. In order of
increasing flexibility, these are the translation, the rigid, the similarity,
the affine, the nonrigid B-spline and the nonrigid thin-plate spline like
transformations.

\begin{description}
\item[Translation:] (\texttt{TranslationTransform}) The translation is defined as:
\begin{align}
\vTmx &= \vx + \bm{t},
\end{align}
with $\bm{t}$ the translation vector. The parameter vector is
simply defined by $\vmu=\bm{t}$.

\item[Rigid:] (\texttt{EulerTransform}) A rigid transformation is defined as:
\begin{align}
\vTmx &= R (\vx - \bm{c}) + \bm{t} + \bm{c},
\end{align}
with the matrix $R$ a rotation matrix (i.e. orthonormal and
proper), $\bm{c}$ the centre of rotation, and $\bm{t}$ translation
again. The image is treated as a rigid body, which can translate
and rotate, but cannot be scaled/stretched. The rotation matrix is
parameterised by the Euler angles (one in 2D, three in 3D). The
parameter vector $\vmu$ consists of the Euler angles (in rad) and
the translation vector. In 2D, this gives a vector of length 3:
$\vmu = (\theta_z, t_x, t_y)^T$, where $\theta_z$ denotes the
rotation around the axis normal to the image. In 3D, this gives a
vector of length 6: $\vmu = (\theta_x, \theta_y, \theta_z, t_x,
t_y, t_z)^T$. The centre of rotation is not part of $\vmu$; it is
a fixed setting, usually the centre of the image.

\item[Similarity:] (\texttt{SimilarityTransform}) A similarity transformation is defined as
\begin{align}
\vTmx &= s \bm{R} (\vx - \bm{c}) + \bm{t} + \bm{c},
\end{align}
with $s$ a scalar and $\bm{R}$ a rotation matrix. This means that the image
is treated as an object, which can translate, rotate, and scale
isotropically. The rotation matrix is parameterised by an angle in 2D, and
by a so-called ``versor'' in 3D (Euler angles could have been used as
well). The parameter vector $\vmu$ consists of the angle/versor, the
translation vector, and the isotropic scaling factor. In 2D, this gives a
vector of length 4: $\vmu = (s, \theta_z, t_x, t_y)^T$. In 3D, this gives a
vector of length 7: $\vmu = (q_1, q_2, q_3, t_x, t_y, t_z, s)^T$, where
$q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$ are the elements of the versor. There are few cases
when you need this transform.

\item[Affine:] (\texttt{AffineTransform}) An affine transformation is defined as:
\begin{align}
\vTmx &= \bm{A} (\vx - \bm{c}) + \bm{t} + \bm{c},
\end{align}
where the matrix $\bm{A}$ has no restrictions. This means that the
image can be translated, rotated, scaled, and sheared. The parameter
vector $\vmu$ is formed by the matrix elements $a_{ij}$ and the
translation vector. In 2D, this gives a vector of length 6:
$\vmu=(a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{21}, a_{22}, t_x, t_y)^T$. In 3D, this
gives a vector of length 12.

We also have implemented another flavor of the affine
transformation, with identical meaning, but using another
parametrization. Instead of having $\vmu$ formed by the matrix
elements + translation, it is formed by $d$ rotations, $d$ shear
factors, $d$ scales, and $d$ translations. The definition reads:
\begin{align}
\vTmx &= \bm{R} \bm{G} \bm{S} (\vx - \bm{c}) + \bm{t} + \bm{c},
\end{align}
with $\bm{R}$, $\bm{G}$ and $\bm{S}$ the rotation, shear and scaling
matrix, respectively. It can be selected using
\texttt{AffineDTITransform}, as it was first made with DTI imaging
in mind, although it can be used anywhere else as well. It has 7
parameters in 2D and 12 parameters in 3D.

\item[B-splines:] (\texttt{BSplineTransform}) For the category of non-rigid
    transformations, B-splines \citep{RueckertEA99} are often used as a
    parameterisation:
\begin{align}
\vTmx = \vx + \sum_{\vx_k \in \Ncal_{\vx}} \bm{p}_k
\bm{\beta}^3\left( \frac{\vx - \vx_k}{\bm{\sigma}}
\right),\label{eq:bspline}
\end{align}
with $\vx_k$ the control points, $\bm{\beta}^3(x)$ the cubic
multidimensional B-spline polynomial \citep{Unser99}, $\bm{p}_k$ the
B-spline coefficient vectors (loosely speaking, the control point
displacements), $\bm{\sigma}$ the B-spline control point spacing, and
$\Ncal_{\vx}$ the set of all control points within the compact support of
the B-spline at $\vx$. The control points $\vx_k$ are defined on a regular
grid, overlayed on the fixed image. In this context we talk about `the
control point grid that is put on the fixed image', and about `control
points that are moved around'. Note that $\vTm(\vx_k)\neq \vx_k +
\bm{p}_k$, a common misunderstanding. Calling $\bm{p}_k$ the control point
displacements is, therefore, actually somewhat misleading. Also note that
the control point grid is entirely unrelated to the grid used by the Grid
image sampler, see Section~\ref{sec:comp:sampler}.

The control point grid is defined by the amount of space between the
control points $\bm{\sigma} = (\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_d)$ (with
$d$ the image dimension), which can be different for each direction.
B-splines have local support ($|\Ncal_{\vx}|$ is small), which means
that the transformation of a point can be computed from only a
couple of surrounding control points. This is beneficial both for
modelling local transformations, and for fast computation. The
parameters $\vmu$ are formed by the B-spline coefficients
$\bm{p}_k$. The number of control points $\bm{P} = (P_1, \ldots,
P_d)$ determines the number of parameters $M$, by $M = ( P_1 \times
\ldots \times P_d ) \times d$. $P_i$ in turn is determined by the
image size $\bm{s}$ and the B-spline grid spacing, i.e. $P_i \approx
s_i / \sigma_i$ (where we use $\approx$ since some additional
control points are placed just outside the image). For 3D images, $M
\approx 10000$ parameters is not an unusual case, and $M$ can easily
grow to $10^5 - 10^6$. The parameter vector (for 2D images) is
composed as follows: $\vmu = (p_{1x}, p_{2x}, \ldots, p_{P_1},
p_{1y}, p_{2y}, \ldots, p_{P_2} )^T$.

\item[Thin-plate splines:] (\texttt{SplineKernelTransform}) Thin-plate
    splines are another well-known representation for nonrigid
    transformations. The thin-plate spline is an instance of the more
    general class of kernel-based transforms \cite{Davis97,Brooks07}. The
    transformation is based on a set of $K$ corresponding landmarks in the
    fixed and moving image: $\vx_k^{\mathrm{fix}}$ and
    $\vx_k^{\mathrm{mov}}, k = 1, \ldots, K$, respectively. The
    transformation is expressed as a sum of an affine component and a
    nonrigid component:
\begin{align}
\vTmx = \vx + A \vx + \bm{t} + \sum_{\vx_k^{\mathrm{fix}}} \bm{c}_k
\bm{G}(\vx - \vx_k^{\mathrm{fix}}),\label{eq:splinekernel}
\end{align}
where $\bm{G}(\bm{r})$ is a basis function and $\bm{c}_k$ are the
coefficients corresponding to each landmark. The coefficients
$\bm{c}_k$ and the elements of $\bm{A}$ and $\bm{t}$ are computed
from the landmark displacements $\bm{d}_k = \vx_k^{\mathrm{mov}} -
\vx_k^{\mathrm{fix}}$. The specific choice of basis function
$\bm{G}(\bm{r})$ determines the ``physical behaviour''. The most
often used choice of $\bm{G}(\bm{r})$ leads to the thin-plate
spline, but another useful alternative is the elastic-body spline
\cite{Davis97}. The spline kernel transforms are often less
efficient than the B-splines (because they lack the compact support
property of the B-splines), but in \elastix\ they allow for more
flexibility in placing the control points $\vx_k^{\mathrm{fix}}$.
The moving landmarks form the parameter vector $\vmu$. Both landmark
sets are needed to define a transformation. Note that in order to
perform a registration, only the fixed landmark positions are given
by the user; the moving landmarks are initialized to equal the fixed
landmarks, corresponding to the identity transformation, and are
subsequently optimized. The parameter vector is (for 2D images)
composed as follows: $\vmu = (x_{1x}^{\mathrm{mov}},
x_{1y}^{\mathrm{mov}}, x_{2x}^{\mathrm{mov}}, x_{2y}^{\mathrm{mov}},
\ldots, x_{Kx}^{\mathrm{mov}}, x_{Ky}^{\mathrm{mov}} )^T$. Note the
difference in ordering of $\vmu$ compared to the B-splines
transform.

\end{figure}
See Figure \ref{fig:transformexample} for an illustration of different
transforms. Choose the transformation that fits your needs: only choose a
nonrigid transformation if you expect that the underlying problem contains
local deformations, choose a rigid transformation if you only need to
compensate for differences in pose. To initialise a nonrigid registration
problem, perform a rigid or affine one first. The result of the initial rigid
or affine registration $\vT_{\hat\vmu_0}$ is combined with a nonrigid
transformation $\vTm^\mathrm{NR}$ in one of the following two ways:
\begin{align}
  \text{addition: }\quad    & \vTmx = \vTm^\mathrm{NR}(\vx) + \vT_{\hat\vmu_0}(\vx) - \vx\label{eq:addition} \\
  \text{composition: }\quad & \vTmx = \vTm^\mathrm{NR}\left( \vT_{\hat\vmu_0}(\vx) \right)
  = ( \vTm^\mathrm{NR} \circ
  \vT_{\hat\vmu_0})(\vx)\label{eq:composition}
\end{align}
The latter method is in general to be preferred, because it makes
several postregistration analysis tasks somewhat more
straightforward.

\section{Optimisers}\label{sec:comp:optimiser}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{gd_example.eps}
\caption{Iterative optimisation. Example for registration with a
translation transformation model. The arrows indicate the steps
$a_k \bm{d}_k$ taken in the direction of the optimum, which is the
minimum of the cost function.} \label{fig:optimisation}
\end{figure}
To solve the optimisation problem (\ref{eq:parametric}), i.e. to
obtain the optimal transformation parameter vector $\hat\vmu$,
commonly an iterative optimisation strategy is employed:
\begin{align}
\vmu_{k+1} &= \vmu_k + a_k \bm{d}_k, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \cdots,
\end{align}
with $\bm{d}_k$ the `search direction' at iteration $k$, $a_k$ a
scalar gain factor controlling the step size along the search
direction. The optimisation process is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:optimisation}. \citet{KleinEA07} give an overview of
various optimisation routines the literature offers. Examples are
quasi-Newton (QN), nonlinear conjugate gradient (NCG), gradient
descent (GD), and Robbins-Monro (RM). Gradient descent and
Robbins-Monro are discussed below. For details on other
optimisation methods we refer to \citep{KleinEA07,NocedalEA99}.

\begin{description}
\item[Gradient descent (GD):] (\texttt{StandardGradientDescent}
or \texttt{RegularStepGradientDescent}) Gradient descent optimisation
methods take the search direction as the negative gradient of the
cost function:
\begin{align}
\vmu_{k+1} &= \vmu_k - a_k \bm{g}(\vmu_k),\label{eq:gd}
\end{align}
with $\bm{g}(\vmu_k) = \partial \mathcal{C} / \partial \vmu$
evaluated at the current position $\vmu_k$. Several choices exist for
the gain factor $a_k$. It can for example be determined by a line
search or by using a predefined function of $k$.

\item[Robbins-Monro (RM):]
(\texttt{StandardGradientDescent} or
\texttt{FiniteDifferenceGradientDescent}) The RM optimisation
method replaces the calculation of the derivative of the cost
function $\bm{g}(\vmu_k)$ by an approximation
$\widetilde{\bm{g}}_k$.
\begin{align}
\vmu_{k+1} &= \vmu_k - a_k \widetilde{\bm{g}}_k,\label{eq:RM}
\end{align}
The approximation is potentially faster to compute, but might
deteriorate convergence properties of the GD scheme, since every
iteration an approximation error $\bm{g}(\vmu_k) -
\widetilde{\bm{g}}_k$ is made. \citet{KleinEA07} showed that using
only a small random subset of voxels (\mbox{$\approx 2000$}) from
the fixed image accelerates registration significantly, without
compromising registration accuracy. The \texttt{Random} or
\texttt{RandomCoordinate} samplers, described in
Section~\ref{sec:comp:sampler}, are examples of samplers that pick
voxels randomly. It is important that a new subset of fixed image
voxels is selected every iteration $k$, so that the approximation
error has zero mean. The RM method is usually combined with $a_k$ as
a predefined decaying function of $k$:
\begin{align}
a_k &= \frac{a}{(k+A)^{\alpha}},\label{eq:gain}
\end{align}
where $a > 0$, $A \ge 1$, and $0 \le \alpha \le 1$ are
user-defined constants. In our experience, a reasonable choice is
$\alpha \approx 0.6$ and $A$ approximately 10\% of the
user-defined maximum number of iterations, or less. The choice of
the overall gain, $a$, depends on the expected ranges of $\vmu$
and $\bm{g}$ and is thus problem-specific. In our experience, the
registration result is not very sensitive to small perturbations
of these parameters. Section~\ref{sec:optimizertuning} gives some
more advice.
\end{description}

Note that GD and RM are in fact very similar. Running RM with a Full sampler
(see Section~\ref{sec:comp:sampler}), instead of a Random sampler, is
equivalent to performing GD. We recommend the use of RM over GD, since it is so
much faster, without compromising on accuracy. In that case, the parameter $a$
is the parameter that is to be tuned for your application. A more advanced
version of the \texttt{StandardGradientDescent} is the
\texttt{AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent}, which requires less parameters to
be set and tends to be more robust \cite{Klein09}.

Other optimisers available in \elastix\ are: \texttt{FullSearch},
\texttt{ConjugateGradient}, \texttt{ConjugateGradientFRPR},
\texttt{QuasiNewtonLBFGS}, \texttt{RSGDEachParameterApart},
\texttt{SimultaneousPerturbation}, \texttt{CMAEvolutionStrategy}.

\section{Multi-resolution}\label{sec:comp:multiresolution}

For a good overview of multi-resolution strategies see
\citet{LesterEA99}. Two hierarchical methods are distinguished:
reduction of data complexity, and reduction of transformation
complexity.

\subsection{Data complexity}

It is common to start the registration process using images that have
lower complexity, e.g., images that are smoothed and possibly
downsampled. This increases the chance of successful registration. A
series of images with increasing amount of smoothing is called a
scale space. If the images are not only smoothed, but also
downsampled, the data is not only less complex, but the \emph{amount}
of data is actually reduced. In that case, we talk about a
``pyramid''. However, confusingly, the word pyramid is used by us
also to refer to a scale space. Several scale spaces or pyramids are
found in the literature, amongst others Gaussian and Laplacian
pyramids, morphological scale space, and spline and wavelet pyramids.
The Gaussian pyramid is the most common one. In \elastix\ we have:
\begin{description}
\item[Gaussian pyramid:] (\texttt{FixedRecursiveImagePyramid} and
\texttt{MovingRecursiveImagePyramid}) Applies smoothing and
down-sampling.

\item[Gaussian scale space:] (\texttt{FixedSmoothingImagePyramid} and
\texttt{MovingSmoothingImagePyramid}) Applies smoothing and
\emph{no} down-sampling.

\item[Shrinking pyramid:] (\texttt{FixedShrinkingImagePyramid} and
\texttt{MovingShrinkingImagePyramid}) Applies \emph{no} smoothing,
but only down-sampling.
\end{description}

Figure~\ref{fig:multiresolution} shows the Gaussian pyramid with and
without downsampling. In combination with a Full sampler (see
Section~\ref{sec:comp:sampler}), using a pyramid with downsampling
will save a lot of time in the first resolution levels, because the
image contains much fewer voxels. In combination with a Random
sampler, or RandomCoordinate, the downsampling step is not necessary,
since the random samplers select a user-defined number of samples
anyway, independent of the image size.

\caption{Two multi-resolution strategies using a Gaussian pyramid
($\sigma = 8.0, 4.0, 2.0$ voxels). The first row shows
multi-resolution with down-sampling
(\texttt{FixedRecursiveImagePyramid}), the second row without
(\texttt{FixedSmoothingImagePyramid}). Note that in the first row,
for each dimension, the image size is halved every resolution, but
that the voxel size increases with a factor 2, so physically the
images are of the same size every resolution.}
\label{fig:multiresolution}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Transformation complexity}

The second multiresolution strategy is to start the registration
with fewer degrees of freedom for the transformation model. The
degrees of freedom of the transformation equals the length (number
of elements) of the parameter vector $\vmu$.

An example of this was already mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:comp:transform}:
the use of a rigid transformation prior to nonrigid (B-spline) registration. We
may even use a three-level strategy: first rigid, then affine, then nonrigid
B-spline.

Another example is to increase the number of degrees of freedom
within the transformation model. With a B-spline transformation,
it is often good practice to start registration with a coarse
control point grid, only capable of modelling coarse deformations.
In subsequent resolutions the B-spline grid is gradually refined,
thereby introducing the capability to match smaller structures.
See Section~\ref{sec:transformtuning}.

\section{Evaluating registration}\label{sec:evaluation}

How do you verify that your registration was successful? This is a
difficult problem. In general, you don't know for each voxel where
it should map to. Here are some hints:

\begin{itemize}
\item The deformed moving image $I_M(\vT_{\vmu}(\vx))$ should
look similar to the fixed image $I_F(\vx)$. So, compare images side
by side in a viewer. You can also display the two images on top of
each other with a checkerboard view or a dragable cross. Besides
looking similar, also check that the deformed moving image has the
same texture as the moving image. Sudden blurred areas in the
deformed image may indicate that the deformation at that region is
too large.

\item For mono-modal image data you can inspect the difference
image. Perfect registration would result in a difference image
without any edges, just noise.

\item Compute the overlap of segmented anatomical structures
after registration. The better the overlap, the better the
registration. Note that this requires you to (manually) segment
structures in your data. To measure overlap, commonly the Dice
similarity coefficient (DSC) is used:
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{DSC}(X,Y) = \frac{2 |X \cap Y|}{|X|+|Y|},
\end{equation}
where $X$ and $Y$ represent the binary label images, and $|\cdot|$
denotes the number of voxels that equal 1. A higher DSC indicates a
better correspondence. A value of 1 indicates perfect overlap, a
value of 0 means no overlap at all. Also the Tannimoto coefficient
(TC) is used often. It is related to the DSC by
$\mathrm{DSC}=2\mathrm{TC}/(\mathrm{TC}+1)$. See also
\cite{Cru06:Generalized}. It is important to realise that the
surface-volume ratio of the segmented structures influences the
overlap values you typically get \citep{Roh04:Evaluation}. A value
of $\mathrm{DSC}=0.8$ would be very good for the overlap of complex
vessel structures. For large spherical objects though, an overlap
$<0.9$ is in general not very good. What is good enough depends of
course on your application.

\item Compute the distance after registration between points that
you know correspond. You can obtain corresponding points by manually
clicking them in the fixed and the moving image. A less
time-consuming option is the semi-automated approach of Murphy
\etal\ \cite{Murphy08}, which is designed for finding corresponding
points in the lung. Ideally, the registration has found the same
correspondence as the ground truth.

\item Inspect the deformation field by looking at the determinant of
the Jacobian of $\vTmx$. Values smaller than 1 indicate local
compression, values larger than 1 indicate local expansion, and 1
means volume preservation. The measure is quantitative: a value of
1.1 means a 10\% increase in volume. If this value deviates
substantially from 1, you may be worried (but maybe not if this is
what you expect for your application). In case it is negative you
have ``foldings'' in your transformation, and you definitely should
be worried.

\item Inspect the convergence, by computing for each iteration
the exact metric value (and not an approximated value, when you do
random sampling), and plot it. For example for the MSD measure, the
lower the metric value, the better the registration.

\item Do not use image similarity as a way to evaluate your
registration. Torsten Rohlfing can explain why \cite{Rohlfing2012}.

\end{itemize}

% There are papers about evaluation of registration

\section{Visualizing registration}\label{sec:visualization}

\elastix\ is a command line program and does not do visualization.
It takes the input fixed and moving image and at the end of the
registration generates an output (result) image. Usually, however,
you will need to inspect the end result visually. For this you can
use an external viewer. Such a viewer does not come with the
\elastix\ package, but is a stand-alone application, with dedicated
functionality for visualization. We have listed a number of
visualization tools in Table \ref{table:visualization}. All of them
are freely available, sometimes even as open source. The list is not
exhaustive.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:elastix:intro}

The development of \elastix\ started half to late 2003, and was
intended to facilitate our registration research. After some initial
versions we decided to put the separate components of \elastix\ in
separate libraries. This resulted in major version 3.0 in November
2004. \elastix\ 3.0 was also the first version that was made
publicly available on the \elastix\ website, around the same time.
The continued development brings us today (\today) to version 5.0.

\subsection{Key features}\label{sec:elastix:key}

\elastix\ is
\begin{itemize}
\item open source, freely available from \url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl};

\item based on the ITK, so the code base is thoroughly tested.
Quite some modifications/additions are made to the original ITK
code though, such as the use of samplers, a transformation class
that combines multiple transformation using composition or
addition, and more.

\item suitable for many image formats. The use of ITK implies that all
    image formats supported by ITK are supported by \elastix. Some often
    used (medical) image formats are: .mhd (MetaIO), .hdr (Analyze), .nii
    (NIfTI), .gipl, .dcm (DICOM slices). DICOM directories are not directly
    supported by \elastix;

\item multi-platform (at least Windows, Linux and Mac OS), multi-compiler
    (at least Visual C++ 2010, 2015, gcc 4.x, clang 3.3+), and supports
    32 and 64 bit systems. The underlying ITK code builds on many more
    platforms, see \url{www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Prerequisites}. So, it is
    highly portable to the platform of the user's choice;

\item highly configurable: there is a lot of choice for all the registration
components. Choosing the configuration that suits your needs is easy
thanks to human readable and editable parameter file;

\item fast, thanks to stochastic subsampling \cite{KleinEA07}, and thanks to
multi-threading and code optimizations \cite{Shamonin2014};

\item relatively easy to extend, i.e. to add new components, so it is
very suited for research also;

\item easy to use for large amounts of data, since \elastix\ can be
called easily in a script;

\item and since 2016 even more user-friendly with the development of
\texttt{SimpleElastix}. \texttt{SimpleElastix} provides native
bindings in scripting languages like Python, Java, R, Ruby, Octave,
Lua, Tcl and C\#, making it possible to stay in your favorite
environment. More information can be found at
\url{http://simpleelastix.github.io/}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Getting started}\label{sec:elastix:install}

This section describes how you can install \elastix, either directly
from the binaries, or by compiling \elastix\ yourself.

\subsection{Getting started the really easy way}

The easiest way to get started with \elastix\ is to use the
pre-compiled binaries.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the compressed archive. From \elastix\ v4.9.0 onwards
the binaries can be found at GitHub:
    \begin{quote}
    \url{https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix/releases}
    \end{quote}

Binaries for \elastix\ v4.8.0 and earlier can be found at:
    \begin{quote}
    \url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/download.php}
    \end{quote}

\item Extract the archive to a \texttt{folder} of your choice.

\item Make sure your operating system can find the program:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Windows 7 and Windows 10: Go to the control panel, go to ``System'', go to
    ``Advanced system settings'', click ``Environmental variables'',
    add \texttt{folder} to the variable ``path''.

    \item Linux: Add the following lines to your \texttt{.bashrc} file:
       \begin{quote}
       \texttt{export PATH=folder/bin:\$PATH}\\
       \texttt{export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=folder/lib:\$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}
       \end{quote}

    \item Mac: Use \texttt{DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} instead of \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}

    \end{enumerate}
    or call \elastix\ with the full path:
    \texttt{fullPathToFolder$\backslash$elastix}. Note that in Linux and Mac, you
    will have to set the \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} or \texttt{DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} anyway.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Getting started the easy way}

It is also possible to compile \elastix\ yourself, since the source
code is freely available. In this section, we assume you use the
Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 (or higher) compiler under Windows, and
the GCC compiler under Linux/MacOS.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download and install CMake: \url{www.cmake.org}.

\item Download and compile the ITK version 5.0.1: \url{www.itk.org}.
    Optionally set the following (advanced) CMake variables to
    \texttt{ON}: \texttt{ITK\_USE\_64BITS\_IDS}
    and \texttt{ITK\_LEGACY\_REMOVE}. For faster building of ITK
    you can switch off \texttt{BUILD\_EXAMPLES} and
    \texttt{BUILD\_TESTING}.

\item Obtain the sources. There are three possibilities:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Download the compressed sources from GitHub. Extract the
      archive to \texttt{<your-elastix-folder>} of your choice.
  \item Use \texttt{git} (\url{https://git-scm.com/})
      to clone the release from the GitHub repository:
    \begin{verbatim}
    git clone https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix.git <your-elastix-folder>
    \end{verbatim}
  \item Checkout the release you are interested in:
    \begin{verbatim}
    git checkout 5.0.0
    \end{verbatim}
  \item Follow the \texttt{develop} branch for the latest development.
    NB: this version might be unstable!
  \end{enumerate}

\item Run CMake for \elastix:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Windows: start CMake. Find the folder with the
        source code. Set the folder where you want the binaries to be
        created. Click ``Configure'' and select the compiler that you
        use. Set the \texttt{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} to the directory
        where you want \elastix\ installed. Click ``Configure'' until
        all cache values are no longer red, and click ``Generate''.

    \item Linux: run CMake from the folder where you want the binaries
        to be created, with as command line argument the folder in
        which the sources were extracted: \texttt{ccmake <src-folder>}.
        Set the \texttt{CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE} to ``Release'' and the
        \texttt{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} to the directory where you want
        \elastix\ installed.
    \end{enumerate}
CMake will create a project or solution or make file for your
compiler.

\item Compile \elastix\ by opening the project and selecting ``compile'' in
    release mode, or on Linux by running \texttt{make install}. Your
    compiler will now create the \elastix\ binaries. On Windows you can
    perform the installation step (which copies the binaries to the
    \texttt{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} directory) by also `compiling' the
    \texttt{INSTALL} project.

\item Make sure your operating system can find the program, see
above.
\end{enumerate}

For developers: When running CMake, you may toggle the display of the
``advanced'' options. In this list you will find several options like
\texttt{USE\_BSplineTransform ON/OFF}. By default only the most commonly used
components are ON. To reduce compilation time, you may turn some components
OFF, which you do not plan to use anyway. Be careful though to not turn off
essential components. The released binaries are compiled with all components
ON.

\section{How to call \elastix}\label{sec:elastix:call}

\elastix\ is a command line program, although since version 4.7
(February 2014) support for a library interface is available, see
Section \ref{ssec:dev:library}. This means that you have to open a
command line interface (a DOS-box, a shell) and type in an
appropriate \elastix\ command. This also means that there is no
graphical user interface. Help on using the program can be acquired
as follows:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{elastix --help}
\end{quote}
which will give a list of mandatory and optional arguments. The most
basic command to run a registration is as follows:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{elastix -f fixedImage.ext -m movingImage.ext -out
outputDirectory -p parameterFile.txt}
\end{quote}
where `\texttt{ext}' is the extension of the image files. The above
arguments are mandatory. These are minimally needed to run \elastix.
The parameter file is an important file: it contains, in normal
text, what kind of registration is performed (i.e. what metric,
optimiser, etc.) and what the parameters are that define the
registration. It gives a high amount of flexibility and control over
the process. More information about the parameter file is given in
Section \ref{sec:elastix:param}. All output of \elastix\ is written
to the output directory, which needs to be created before running
\elastix. The output consists of a log file (\texttt{elastix.log}),
the parameters of the transformation $\vT_{\vmu}$ that relates the
fixed and the moving image (\texttt{TransformParameters.?.txt}),
and, optionally, the resulting registered image $I_M(\vTmx)$
(\texttt{result.?.mhd}). The log file contains all messages that
were print to screen during registration. Also the
\texttt{parameterFile.txt} is copied into the log file, and the
contents of the \texttt{TransformParameters.?.txt} files are
included. The log file is thus especially useful for trouble
shooting.

Besides the mandatory arguments, there are some optional
arguments. Mask images can be provided by adding \texttt{-fMask
fixedMask.ext} and/or \texttt{-mMask movingMask.ext} to the
command line. An initial transformation can be provided with a
valid transform parameter file by adding \texttt{-t0
TransformParameters.txt} to the command line. With the command
line option \texttt{-threads unsigned\_int} the user can specify
the maximum number of threads that \elastix\ will use.

Running multiple registrations in succession, each possibly of a
different type, and with the output of a previous registration as
input to the next, can be done with \elastix\ in several ways. The
first one is to run \elastix\ once with the first registration, and
use its output (the \texttt{TransformParameter.0.txt} that can be
found in the output directory) as input for a new run of \elastix\
with the command line argument \texttt{-t0}. So:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{elastix -f ... -m ... -out out1 -p param1.txt} \\
\texttt{elastix -f ... -m ... -out out2 -p param2.txt -t0
out1/TransformParameters.0.txt} \\
\texttt{elastix -f ... -m ... -out out3 -p param3.txt -t0
out2/TransformParameters.0.txt}
\end{quote}
and so on. Another possibility is combine the registrations with one
run of \elastix:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{elastix ... -p param1.txt -p param2.txt -p param3.txt}
\end{quote}
The transformations from each of the registrations are automatically
combined, using one of the equations (\ref{eq:addition}) and
(\ref{eq:composition}).

On the \elastix-website, in the `About' section, you can find an
example on how to use the program. Maybe now is the time to try
the example and see a registration in action.


\section{The parameter file}\label{sec:elastix:param}

The parameter file is a text file that defines the components of the
registration and their parameter values. Supplying a parameter works
as follows:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(ParameterName value(s))}
\end{quote}
So parameters are provided between brackets, first the name,
followed by one or more values. If the value is of type string then
the values need to be quoted:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(ParameterName "value1" ... "valueN")}
\end{quote}
Comments can be provided by starting the line with `\texttt{//}'.
The order in which the parameters are given does not matter, but
parameters can only be specified once. A minimal example of a valid
parameter file is given in Appendix \ref{chp:ExampleParam}. A list
of available parameters for each class is given at
\url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/doxygen/parameter.html}. Examples of
parameter files can be found at the wiki:
\url{http://elastix.bigr.nl/wiki/index.php/Parameter_file_database}.

Since the choice of the several components and the parameter values
define the registration, it is very important to set them wisely.
These choices are what make the registration a success or a disaster.
Therefore, a separate chapter is dedicated to the fine art of tuning
a registration, see Chapter \ref{chp:Tutorial}.

\chapter{\transformix}\label{chp:transformix}

\section{Introduction}

By now you are able to at least run a registration, by calling
\elastix\ correctly. It is often also useful to apply the
transformation as found by the registration to another image.
Maybe you want to apply the transformation to an original (larger)
image to gain resolution. Or maybe you need the transformation to
apply it to a label image (segmentation). For those purposes a
program called \transformix\ is available. It was developed
simultaneously with \elastix.

\section{How to call \transformix}\label{sec:calltransformix}

Like \elastix, \transformix\ is a command line driven program. You
can get basic help on how to call it, by:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{transformix --help}
\end{quote}
which will give a list of mandatory and optional arguments.

The most basic command is as follows:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{transformix -in inputImage.ext -out outputDirectory -tp
TransformParameters.txt}
\end{quote}
This call will transform the input image and write it, together
with a log file \texttt{transformix.log}, to the output directory.
The transformation you want to apply is defined in the transform
parameter file. The transform parameter file could be the result
of a previous run of \elastix\ (see Section
\ref{sec:elastix:call}), but may also be written by yourself.
Section~\ref{sec:transformix:tp} explains the structure and
contents that a transform parameter file should have.

Besides using \transformix\ for deforming images, you can also use
\transformix\ to evaluate the transformation $\vTmx$ at some points
$\vx \in \Omega_F$. This means that the input points are specified
in the fixed image domain (!), since the transformation direction is
from fixed to moving image, as explained in Section
\ref{sec:comp:transform}. If you want to deform a set of
user-specified points, the appropriate call is:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{transformix -def inputPoints.txt -out outputDirectory -tp
TransformParameters.txt}
\end{quote}
This will create a file \texttt{outputpoints.txt} containing the
input points $\vx$ and the transformed points $\vTmx$ (given as
voxel indices of the fixed image and additionally as physical
coordinates), the displacement vector $\vTmx - \vx$ (in physical
coordinates), and, if \texttt{-in inputImage.ext} is also specified,
the transformed output points as indices of the input
image\footnote{The downside of this is that the input image is also
deformed, which consumes time and may not be needed by the user. If
this is a problem, just run \transformix\ without \texttt{-in} and
compute the voxel indices yourself, based on the $\vTmx$ physical
coordinate data.}. The \texttt{inputPoints.txt} file should have the
following structure:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{<index, point>}\\
\texttt{<number of points>}\\
\texttt{point1\_x point1\_y [point1\_z]}\\
\texttt{point2\_x point2\_y [point2\_z]}\\
\texttt{$\ldots$}
\end{quote}
The first line indicates whether the points are given as
``indices'' (of the fixed image), or as ``points'' (in physical
coordinates). The second line stores the number of points that
will be specified. After that the point data is given.

Instead of the custom \texttt{.txt} format for the input points, \transformix\
also supports \texttt{.vtk} files:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{transformix -def inputPoints.vtk -out outputDirectory -tp
TransformParameters.txt}
\end{quote}
The output is then saved as \texttt{outputpoints.vtk}. The support
for \texttt{.vtk} files is still a bit limited. Currently, only
ASCII files are supported, with triangular meshes. Any meta point
data is lost in the output file.

If you want to know the deformation at all voxels of the fixed
image, simply use \texttt{-def all}:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{transformix -def all -out outputDirectory -tp
TransformParameters.txt}
\end{quote}
The deformation field is stored as a vector image
\texttt{deformationField.mhd}. Each voxel contains the
displacement vector $\vTmx-\vx$ in physical coordinates. The
elements of the vectors are stored as \texttt{float} values.

In addition to computing the deformation field, \transformix\ has
the capability to compute the spatial Jacobian of the
transformation. The determinant of the spatial Jacobian identifies
the amount of local compression or expansion and can be quite
useful, for example in lung ventilation studies. The determinant of
the spatial Jacobian can be computed on the entire image only using:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{transformix -jac all -out outputDirectory -tp
TransformParameters.txt}
\end{quote}
The complete spatial Jacobian matrix can also be computed:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{transformix -jacmat all -out outputDirectory -tp
TransformParameters.txt}
\end{quote}
where each voxel is filled with a $d \times d$ matrix, with $d$ the
image dimension, instead of a simply a scalar value.

With the command-line option \texttt{-threads unsigned\_int} the
user can specify the maximum number of threads that \transformix\
will use.

\section{The transform parameter file}\label{sec:transformix:tp}

The result of a registration is the transformation $\vTm$ relating
the fixed and moving image. The parameters of this transformation
are stored in a \texttt{TransformParameters.?.txt}-file. An
example of its structure for a 2D rigid transformation is given in
Appendix \ref{chp:ExampleTransformParam}. The text file contains
all information necessary to resample an input image (the moving
image) to the region specified in the file (by default the fixed
image region).

The transform parameter file can be manually edited or created as
is convenient for the user. Multiple transformations are composed
by iteratively supplying another transform parameter file with the
\texttt{InitialTransformParametersFileName} tag. The last
transformation will be the one where the initial transform
parameter file name is set to \texttt{"NoInitialTransform"}.

An important parameter in the transform parameter files is the
\texttt{FinalBSplineInterpolationOrder}. Usually it is set to 3, because that
produces the best quality result image after registration, see
Sec~\ref{sec:interpolatortuning}. However, if you use \transformix\ to deform a
\emph{segmentation} of the moving image (so, a binary image), you need to
manually change the \texttt{FinalBSplineInterpolationOrder} to 0. This will
make sure that the deformed segmentation is still a binary label image. If
third order interpolation is used, the deformed segmentation image will contain
garbage. This is related to the ``overshoot-property'' of higher-order B-spline
interpolation.

\section{Some details}

\subsection{Run-time}

The run-time of \transformix\ is built up of the following parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Computing the B-spline decomposition of the input image (in case you
    selected the \texttt{FinalBSpline}-\texttt{Interpolator});

\item Computing the transformation for each voxel;

\item Interpolating the input image for each voxel.
\end{enumerate}
We have never performed tests to measure the computational
complexity of each step, but we think that step 1 is the least
time-consuming task. This step can obviously be avoided by using a
nearest neighbour or linear interpolator. Step 2 is dependent on the
choice of the transformation, where linear transformations, such as
the rigid and affine transform, are substantially faster than
nonlinear transforms, such as the B-spline transform. Step 3 depends
on the specific interpolator. In order of increasing complexity:
nearest neighbour, linear, 1st-order B-spline, 2nd-order B-spline,
etc.

%[What is the complexity of FinalBSplineInterpolator? And of
%FinalLinearInterpolator? In required operations per voxel. Is that
%described in the docs, in some papers, or on the wiki?]

\ref{ssec:tut:memory} and also:

\chapter{Tutorial}\label{chp:Tutorial}


\section{Selecting the registration components}

When performing registration one carefully has to choose the
several components, as specified in Chapter
\ref{chp:Registration}. The components must be specified in the
parameter file. For example:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(Transform "BSplineTransform")}\\
\texttt{(Metric "AdvancedMattesMutualInformation")}\\
$\ldots$
\end{quote}

In Table \ref{table:tutorial:components} a list of the components
that need to be specified is given, with some recommendations. The
``Registration'' component was not mentioned in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Registration}. The registration component serves to
connect all other components and implements the multiresolution
aspect of registration. So, one may say that it actually implements
the block scheme of Figure~\ref{fig:registrationcomponents}. Also
the ``Resampler'' component was not explicitly mentioned in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Registration}. It simply serves to generate the
deformed moving image after registration. Currently there are two
resamplers available in \elastix: the \texttt{DefaultResampler} and
the \texttt{OpenCLResampler}. The latter requires \elastix\ to be
compiled using OpenCL extensions, and of course a decent graphics
card.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|p{15em}}
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Recommendation} \\
\hline
Registration & \texttt{MultiResolutionRegistration} \\
Metric       & \texttt{AdvancedMattesMutualInformation} \\
Sampler      & \texttt{RandomCoordinate} \\
Interpolator & \texttt{LinearInterpolator} \\
ResampleInterpolator & \texttt{FinalBSplineInterpolator} \\
Resampler    & \texttt{DefaultResampler}\\
Transform    & Depends on the application \\
Optimizer    & \texttt{AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent} \\
FixedImagePyramid   & \texttt{FixedSmoothingImagePyramid} \\
MovingImagePyramid  & \texttt{MovingSmoothingImagePyramid} \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Some recommendations for the several components.}\label{table:tutorial:components}
\end{table}

\section{Overview of all parameters}

A list of all available components of \elastix\ can be found at:
\begin{quote}
\url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/doxygen/modules.html}
\end{quote}
A list of all parameters that can be specified for each registration
component can be found at the \elastix\ website:
\begin{quote}
\url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/doxygen/parameter.html}
\end{quote}
At that site you can find how to specify a parameter and what the
default value is. We have tried to come up with sensible defaults,
although the defaults will certainly not work in all cases. A
collection of successful parameter files can be found at the wiki:
\begin{quote}
\url{http://elastix.bigr.nl/wiki/index.php/Parameter_file_database}
\end{quote}
This may get you started with your particular application.

\section{Important parameters}\label{sec:Tutorial:importantparam}

In the same order as in Section \ref{sec:comp:metric} we discuss
the important parameters for each component and explain the
recommendations made in Table~\ref{table:tutorial:components}.

\subsection{Registration}\label{sec:registrationtuning}

Just use the \texttt{MultiResolutionRegistration} method, since
multi-resolution is a good idea. And if you still think you don't
need all this multi-resolution, you can always set the
\texttt{NumberOfResolutions} to 1. You don't have to set anything
else. Section~\ref{sec:pyramidtuning} discusses the number of
resolutions in more detail.

\subsection{Metric}

The \texttt{AdvancedMattesMutualInformation} usually works well,
both for mono- and multi-modal images. It supports fast computation
of the metric value and derivative in case the transform is a
B-spline by exploiting its compact support. You need to set the
number of histogram bins, which is needed to compute the joint
histogram. A good value for this depends on the dynamic range of
your input images, but in our experience 32 is usually ok:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(NumberOfHistogramBins 32)}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Sampler}\label{sec:samplertuning}

The \texttt{RandomCoordinate} sampler works well in conjunction with
the \texttt{StandardGradientDescent} and\\
\texttt{AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent} optimisers, which are the
recommended optimisation routines. These optimisation methods can be
used with a small amount of samples, randomly selected in every
iteration, see Section \ref{sec:comp:optimiser}, which significantly
decreases registration time. Set the \texttt{NumberOfSpatialSamples}
to 3000. Don't go lower than 2000. Compared to samplers that draw
samples on the voxel-grid (such as the \texttt{Random} sampler), the
\texttt{RandomCoordinate} sampler avoids what is known as the
grid-effect \citep{The08:Halton}.

An important option for the random samplers, discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:optimizertuning} is:
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{(NewSamplesEveryIteration "true")}
\end{quote}
which enforces the selection of new samples in every iteration.

An interesting option for the \texttt{RandomCoordinate} sampler is
the \texttt{UseRandomSampleRegion} parameter, used in combination
with the \texttt{SampleRegionSize} parameter. If
\texttt{UseRandomSampleRegion} is set to \texttt{"false"} (the
default), the sampler draws samples from the entire image domain.
When set to \texttt{"true"}, the sampler randomly selects one
voxel, and then selects the remaining samples in a square
neighbourhood around that voxel. The size of the neighbourhood is
determined by the \texttt{SampleRegionSize} (in physical
coordinates). An example for 3D images:
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{(ImageSampler "RandomCoordinate")}\\
  \texttt{(NewSamplesEveryIteration "true")}\\
  \texttt{(UseRandomSampleRegion "true")}\\
  \texttt{(SampleRegionSize 50.0 50.0 50.0)}\\
  \texttt{(NumberOfSpatialSamples 2000)}\\
\end{quote}
In every iteration, a square region of $50^3$\,mm is randomly selected. In that
region, 2000 samples are selected according to a uniform distribution.
Effectively, a kind of \emph{localised} similarity measure is obtained, which
sometimes gives better registration results. See \cite{Kle08:Automatic} for
more information on this approach. For the sample region size a reasonable
value to try is $\approx1/3$ of the image size.

\subsection{Interpolator}\label{sec:interpolatortuning}

During the registration, use the \texttt{LinearInterpolator}. In our
current implementation it is much faster than the first order
B-spline interpolator, even though they are theoretically the same
thing.

We recommend a higher quality third order B-spline interpolator for
generating the resulting deformed moving image:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(ResampleInterpolator "FinalBSplineInterpolator")} \\
\texttt{(FinalBSplineInterpolationOrder 3)}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Transform}\label{sec:transformtuning}

This choice depends on the application at hand. For images of the
same patient where you expect no nonrigid deformation, you can
consider a rigid transformation, i.e. choose the
\texttt{EulerTransform}. If you want to compensate for differences
in scale, consider the affine transformation:
\texttt{AffineTransform}. These two transformations require a centre
of rotation, which can be set by the user. By default the geometric
centre of the fixed image is taken, which is recommended. Another
parameter that needs to be set is the \texttt{Scales}. The scales
define for each element of the transformation parameters $\vmu$ a
scaling value, which is used during optimisation. The scaling serves
to bring the elements of $\vmu$ in the same range (parameters
corresponding to rotation have in general a much smaller range than
parameters corresponding to translation). We recommend to let
\elastix\ compute it automatically:
\texttt{(AutomaticScalesEstimation "true")}\footnote{The
implementation is given in
%\verb=elastix\src\Core\ComponentBaseClasses\elxTransformBase.hxx=}
\texttt{elastix$\backslash$Core$\backslash$ComponentBaseClasses$\backslash$elxTransformBase.hxx}}.
Always start with a rigid or affine transformation before doing a
nonrigid one, to get a good initial alignment.

For nonrigid registration problems \elastix\ has the
\texttt{BSplineTransform}. The B-spline nonrigid transformation is
defined by a uniform grid of control points. This grid is defined
by the spacing between the grid nodes. The spacing defines how
dense the grid is, or what the locality is of the transformation
you can model. For each resolution level you can define a
different grid spacing. This is what we call multi-grid. In
general, we recommend to start with a coarse B-spline grid, i.e. a
more global transformation. This way the larger structures are
matched first, for the same reason as why you should start with a
rigid or affine transformation. In later resolutions you can
refine the transformation in a stepwise fashion; the idea is that
you subsequently match smaller structures, up to the final
precision. The final grid spacing is specified with:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(FinalGridSpacingInPhysicalUnits 10.0 10.0 10.0)}
\end{quote}
with as much numbers as there are dimensions in your image. The
spacing is in most medical images specified in millimetres. It is
also possible to specify the grid in voxel units:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(FinalGridSpacingInVoxels 16.0 16.0 16.0)}
\end{quote}

Note that in the case of providing an affine transformation as
initial transformation to the B-spline registration, \elastix\ will
scale the control point grid to cover the fixed image domain in the
space defined by the initial transform.

If the final B-spline grid spacing is chosen high, then you cannot
match small structures. On the other hand, if the grid spacing is
chosen very low, then small structures can be matched, but you
possibly allow the transformation to have too much freedom. This can
result in irregular transformations, especially on homogenous parts
of your image, since there are no edges (or other information) at
such areas that can guide the registration. A penalty or
regularisation term, see Equation (\ref{eq:registration2}), can help
to avoid these problems. It is hard to recommend a value for the
final grid spacing, since it depends on the desired accuracy. But we
can try: if you are interested in somewhat larger structures, you
could set it to 32 voxels, for matching smaller structures you could
go down to 16 or 8 voxels, or even up to 4. The last choice will
maybe require some regularisation term, unless maybe if you have
carefully and gradually refined the grid spacing.

To specify a multi-grid schedule use the \texttt{GridSpacingSchedule}
command:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(NumberOfResolutions 4)} \\
\texttt{(FinalGridSpacingInVoxels 8.0 8.0)} \\
\texttt{(GridSpacingSchedule 6.0 6.0 4.0 4.0 2.5 2.5 1.0 1.0)}
\end{quote}
The \texttt{GridSpacingSchedule} defines the multiplication
factors for all resolution levels. In combination with the final
grid spacing, the grid spacing for all resolution levels is
determined. In case of 2D images, the above schedule specifies a
grid spacing of $6 \times 8 = 48$ voxels in resolution level 0,
via 32 and 20 voxels, to 8 voxels in the final resolution level.
The default value for the \texttt{GridSpacingSchedule} uses a
powers-of-2 scheme: \texttt{(GridSpacingSchedule 8.0 8.0 4.0 4.0
2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0)} (for 2D images).

As a side-note: the number of parameters that are minimised in
(\ref{eq:registration1}) is determined by the size of $\vmu$, i.e.
in case of the B-spline deformable transform by the control point
grid spacing. If you double the spacing, the number of parameters
are increased by a factor 8 for a 3D image. For a $256^3$ image and
a grid spacing of 16 voxels this will result in approximately
$(256/16)^3 \times 3 \approx 12.000$ parameters; for a grid spacing
of 8 voxels this is almost 100.000 parameters. The amount of
parameters can be directly related to memory consumption and
registration time, depending on the specific implementation.

In most literature, \emph{cubic} (3$^\text{rd}$-order) B-splines are used for
image registration. Other spline orders are also possible of course. You may
experiment with the \texttt{BSplineTransformSplineOrder} option. Orders 1, 2,
and 3 are supported. A lower order will reduce the computation time, but may
cause less smooth deformations. With order 1, the deformation field is not even
differentiable anymore, strictly speaking.

Since \elastix\ 4.9 we have a new implementation for the B-spline
transform available, which gives numerically the same results as the
default implementation. It is however quite a bit faster, because it
exploits the recursive property of the B-spline, which we combined
with Template Meta Programming tricks \cite{Huizinga2014}. The new
implementation can be selected using:
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{(Transform "RecursiveBSplineTransform")}
\end{quote}

As an alternative to the B-spline transform, \elastix\ includes the
\texttt{SplineKernelTransform}, which implements a thin-plate spline type of
transform. See Sections \ref{sec:comp:transform} and \ref{sec:adv:transform}
for more information on this transform.

Lastly, it is wise to include the following line in every
parameter file:
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{(HowToCombineTransforms "Compose")}
\end{quote}
Up to \elastix\ version 4.2, by default, if this line was omitted,
\texttt{"Add"} was used for backwards compatibility. From \elastix\ version
4.3, the default has been changed to \texttt{"Compose"}, which is better in
most applications. See Section \ref{sec:comp:transform}, Equations
(\ref{eq:addition}) and (\ref{eq:composition}) for explanation.

\subsection{Optimiser}\label{sec:optimizertuning}

The \texttt{StandardGradientDescent} method, see Equations
(\ref{eq:gd}) and (\ref{eq:gain}) offers the possibility to
perform fast registration, see \cite{KleinEA07}. The key idea is
that you use a random subset of voxels (samples), newly selected
in each iteration, to compute the cost function derivatives. The
number of samples to use is specified using the parameter
\texttt{NumberOfSpatialSamples}, see
Section~\ref{sec:samplertuning}. Typically, 2000-5000 is enough.
It is important to tell the optimiser to select new samples in
every iteration:
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{(NewSamplesEveryIteration "true")}
\end{quote}

A downside of the \texttt{StandardGradientDescent} method is that
you need to tune the parameters of the gain factor $a_k$, see
Section \ref{sec:Tutorial:importantparam}. Equation (\ref{eq:RM})
needs a choice for the step size $a_k$, which is in \elastix\
defined as in Equation (\ref{eq:gain}). Figure~\ref{fig:stepsize}
gives some examples.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering \psfrag{k}[tc][tc]{$k$} \psfrag{ak}[tc][tc]{$a_k$}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{ak.eps}
\caption{Sequence 1: $a = 1000$, $A = 50$, $\alpha = 0.602$.
Sequence 2: $a = 400$, $A = 10$, $\alpha = 0.602$. Both sequences
start with the same step size, but sequence 2 decays much
faster.}\label{fig:ak}
\end{figure}
The parameters $\alpha$ and $A$ define the decay slope of the
function. For the parameter $\alpha$ we recommend the value 0.6.
For $A$, use something in the order of 50:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(SP\_alpha 0.6)} \\
\texttt{(SP\_A 50.0)}
\end{quote}
This leaves the parameter $a$, called \texttt{SP\_a} in \elastix,
as the most important parameter to tune. And it is an important
parameter, it can mean success for a good choice and failure if
not! If $a$ is set too high, the iterative solving algorithm
(\ref{eq:RM}) becomes unstable, and you may deform your image
beyond recognition. If $a$ is set too low, you will never make it
to the optimum, or may get stuck in a very small nearby local
optimum. Figure~\ref{fig:stepsize} illustrates this.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{fixed.eps}}\label{sfig:stepsize:fixed}
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{moving.eps}}\label{sfig:stepsize:moving} \\
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{a320.eps}}\label{sfig:stepsize:a320}
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{a3200.eps}}\label{sfig:stepsize:a3200}
\subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=4cm]{a32000.eps}}\label{sfig:stepsize:a32000}
\caption{The effect of the choice of the step size $a$
(\texttt{SP\_A}). This example can be downloaded from the
\elastix\ website. (a) the fixed image, (b) the moving image.
(c)-(e) show the registered images, with (c) $a = 320$ is too
small, (d) $a = 3200$ as in the downloadable example is good, (e)
$a = 32000$ is too large.} \label{fig:stepsize}
\end{figure}

A good choice for $a$ is dependent on the cost function that is used
for registration: the $a$ that will give you a good result for MSD
is not the same as the one that gives a good result for MI. Finally,
$a$ also depends on the amount of deformation that you expect
between the fixed and the moving image. So again, recommendations
are hard to give. In general we advise you to think in orders of
magnitude, if $a = 10$ is too small, try $a = 100$ and not $a = 11$.
For mutual information, normalised correlation coefficient, and
normalised mutual information, you could start around $a = 1000$.
For the mean squared difference metric you could try something
smaller than 1. If $a$ is chosen way too big, you may encounter the
error message ``Too many samples map outside moving image buffer''.
This error may have other causes as well though. The FAQ at the
\elastix\ website gives more information on this error message.

For every resolution you could specify a different value of
\texttt{SP\_a}, but it might be easier to start with the same
value for every resolution.
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(SP\_a 1000.0 1000.0 1000.0)}
\end{quote}
or, equivalently:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(SP\_a 1000.0)}
\end{quote}

The last important option related to the optimiser is the maximum
number of iterations:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(MaximumNumberOfIterations 500)}
\end{quote}
which is, in the case of \texttt{StandardGradientDescent}, not only
the maximum, but also the minimum, since there is no other stopping
condition implemented for this optimiser. In general, the more
iterations, the better the registration result. But, of course, more
iterations take more time. A value of 500 is a good start. Use 2000
if computation time is not such an issue. You may try to go down to
200 iterations if you are in a hurry. For small 2D images, and rigid
registration, even less iterations may suffice. A side benefit of
using more iterations is that a wider range of \texttt{SP\_a} gives
good results. Tuning \texttt{SP\_a} then becomes easier.

\begin{quote}
Are you getting tired of the difficulty of tuning $a$?
\end{quote}

Start using the \texttt{AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent}
optimizer. This optimizer is very similar to the
\texttt{StandardGradientDescent}, but estimates a proper initial
value for \texttt{SP\_a} \emph{automatically}. See \cite{Klein09}
and \cite{Qiao:2016} for more details. In practice this optimizer
works in many applications with its default settings. Only the
number of iterations must be specified by the user:
\begin{verbatim}
(Optimizer "AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent")
(ASGDParameterEstimationMethod "DisplacementDistribution")
(MaximumNumberOfIterations 500)
\end{verbatim}
There are some optional extra parameters, such as
\texttt{SigmoidInitialTime} and \texttt{MaximumStepLength}, which
are explained in the papers \citep{Klein09,Qiao:2016}. In addition
to automatically computing the step size, this optimizer also
implements an adaptive step size mechanism, which generally makes
the optimization somewhat more robust. A downside of a first version
of this optimizer was that it is relatively time-consuming to
estimate $a$ in case of a large degree of freedom (large size of
$\vmu$). This issue was however addressed in recent work
\citep{Qiao:2016}. The first version can be selected using
\texttt{(ASGDParameterEstimationMethod "Original")}, while the
improved version is selected with\\
\texttt{(ASGDParameterEstimationMethod "DisplacementDistribution")}.

\subsection{Image pyramids}\label{sec:pyramidtuning}

The \texttt{FixedImagePyramid} and the \texttt{MovingImagePyramid}
have identical options. What is said below about the
FixedImagePyramid works similarly for the MovingImagePyramid.

Use the \texttt{FixedSmoothingImagePyramid}, since it will not throw
away valuable information, and since you are not using the
\texttt{FullSampler} anyway, down-sampling will not save you any
time. It may consume quite some memory though for large images and
many resolution levels. Two parameters have to be set to define the
multi-resolution strategy: the number of resolutions
(\texttt{NumberOfResolutions}) and the specific down-sampling
schedule that is used in each resolution
(\texttt{FixedImagePyramidSchedule}). If you only set the
\texttt{NumberOfResolutions}, a default schedule will be used that
smoothes the fixed image by a factor of 2 in each dimension,
starting from $\sigma = 0.5$ in the last resolution. That schedule
is usually fine. In case you have highly anisotropic data, you might
want to blur less in the direction of the largest spacing.

In general 3 resolutions is a good starting point. If the fixed and
moving image are initially far away, you can increase the number of
resolution levels to, say, 5 or 6. This way the images are more
blurred and more attention is paid to register large, dominant
structures.

The pyramid schedule defines the amount of blurring (and
down-sampling in case a \texttt{FixedRecursiveImagePyramid} is used),
in each direction $x,y,z$ and for each resolution level. It can be
specified as follows:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(NumberOfResolutions 4)} \\
\texttt{(FixedImagePyramidSchedule 8 8 4 4 2 2 1 1)}
\end{quote}
In this example 4 resolutions for a 2D image are used. At
resolution level 0 the image is blurred with $\sigma = 8/2$ voxels
in each direction ($\sigma$ is half the pyramid schedule value).
At level 1 $\sigma = 4/2$ is used, and finally at the last level,
level 4, the original images are used for registration. Specifying
the fixed and moving image pyramids with an identical schedule can
be done with one command:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(ImagePyramidSchedule 4 4 2 2 2 1 1 1 1)}
\end{quote}
for a 3D image with 3 resolution levels, where less smoothing is
performed in the $z$-direction.

\section{Masks}

Sometimes you are specifically interested in aligning only a part of
the image. A possibility to focus on this part is to crop the image.
Cropping, however, restricts the region of interest (ROI) to be a
square (2D) or cube (3D) only. If you need an irregular shaped ROI,
you can use masks. A mask is a binary image, filled with 0's and 1's.
If you use a mask, you only perform registration on the part of the
image that is within the masks, i.e. where the mask has 1's.

You can/should use a mask
\begin{itemize}
\item when your image contains an artificial edge that has no real meaning.
The registration might be tempted to align these artificial edges,
thereby neglecting the meaningful edges. The conic beam edge in
ultrasound images is an example of such an artificial edge.

\item when the image contains structures in the neighbourhood
of your ROI that may influence the registration within your ROI.
This is for example the case when matching lung data. Usually, you
are interested in the lungs, and not if the rib cage is well
aligned. However, the ribs are structures that for example in CT can
have a strong influence on the similarity metric, especially if you
use the MSD metric. In that case, the rib cage may be well aligned
at the cost of vessels structures near the border of the lung with
the rib cage. In this case it will help you if you use a dilated
lung segmentation as a mask.
\end{itemize}

Masks can be used both for the fixed and the moving image. A fixed
image mask is sufficient to focus the registration on a ROI, since
samples are drawn from the fixed image. You only want to use a
mask for the moving image when your moving image contains nonsense
grey values near the ROI.

In case you are using a mask to prevent bad karma from an artificial
edge, you also need to set the parameter:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(ErodeMask "true")}
\end{quote}
If not, then when performing multi-resolution, information from the
artificial edge will flow into you ROI due to the smoothing step. In
case the edge around your ROI is meaningful, e.g. in the lung
example, you should set it to false, because this edge will help to
guide the registration.

A common exception that \elastix\ throws when drawing samples is:
``Could not find enough image samples within reasonable time.
Probably the mask is too small.'' The probable cause for this is
that your fixed image mask is too small. See the FAQ for more
information.

\section{Trouble shooting}

\subsection{Common errors}

Some common sources of confusion and questions have been gathered in
a FAQ, which can be found at
\begin{quote}
\url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/FAQ.php}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Bad initial alignment}

When the initial alignment between two images is very off, you cannot
start a nonrigid registration. And sometimes it can be a hassle to
get it right. What factors can help to get it right?

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with a transformation with a low degree of freedom,
i.e. the translation, rigid, similarity or affine transform.
Sometimes the images are really far off, and have no overlap to
begin with (NB: the position of images in physical space is
determined by the origin and voxel spacing; see
Section~\ref{sec:comp:image}). A solution is then to add the
following line to your parameter file:
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{(AutomaticTransformInitialization "true")}
\end{quote}
This parameter facilitates the automatic estimation of an initial
alignment for the aforementioned transformations. Three methods to
do so are supported: the default method which aligns the centres of
the fixed and moving image, a method that aligns the centres of
gravity, and a method that simply aligns the image origins. A method
can be selected by adding one of the following lines to the
parameter file:
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{(AutomaticTransformInitializationMethod "GeometricalCenter")} \\
  \texttt{(AutomaticTransformInitializationMethod "CenterOfGravity")} \\
  \texttt{(AutomaticTransformInitializationMethod "Origins")}
\end{quote}
Note that ``\texttt{Origins}'' is currently only available for the
affine transformation.

\item You need a good multi-resolution strategy, i.e.
quite a bit of resolution levels. This way a lot of smoothing is
going on, blurring away all the details and thereby focussing the
registration on the major structures.

\item Use more iterations.

\item Take larger steps. Set the
parameter $a$ so high that the translation component of the
transformation takes a step of several voxels in each iteration, up
to 10. Maybe it will work, and in that case you will get alignment
pretty quick, but the step size $a$ is still large, so you
immediately jump away from alignment again. If that happens, you
should let the sequence $a_k = a / (A+k)^{\alpha}$ decay relatively
fast. This can be achieved by setting both $a$ and $A$ a bit lower,
see Figure \ref{fig:ak}.

\item In case you need to find a large rotation, you might want to
take larger steps for the rotation, but not for the translation.
This can be achieved by modifying the scales parameter, see
Section \ref{sec:transformtuning}:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(Scales 10000.0)}
\end{quote}
You can set it lower to take larger rotation steps. If it is set
to 1.0 you take as large steps for the rotation as for the
translation (but the rotation is defined in radials). If you set
it really high ($> 10^6$) you won't rotate at all. You probably
don't need to go lower than 1000.0. Note that the
\texttt{AutomaticScalesEstimation} option usually works fine, so
specifying \texttt{Scales} is not necessary.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory consumption}\label{ssec:tut:memory}

The typical size of clinical images increases as a function of time.
Therefore, memory efficiency will become more of an issue. \elastix\
consumes $\approx$ 100 MB of memory for small images, for larger
image pairs ($256^3$) and some common components, consumption can be
about 1 - 1.5 GB. With very large images ($400^3$ and above) memory
consumption can rise above 2 GB limit of older 32-bit Windows
systems. Or perhaps you are using a laptop. Or perhaps you are using
\elastix\ within another memory-consuming master program. What to do
with large images?
\begin{itemize}
\item Buy yourself a brand new computer with a lot of memory.
Nowadays both the computer and the operating system will be 64 bit,
so that you can actually address this much memory.

\item Images in \elastix\ are internally by default represented as a bunch of
voxels of floating type. You can modify this to short images:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(FixedInternalImagePixelType "short")} \\
\texttt{(MovingInternalImagePixelType "short")}
\end{quote}
This way you save half the amount of memory that is used to store the
fixed and moving images, and their multi-resolution pyramids. This
will come at the cost of a loss of precision, but may not be that
harmful. This option is useful both for \elastix\ and \transformix.

\item Change the interpolator that is used during registration. In case
a B-spline interpolator is used, note that it stores a coefficient
image internally in double type. You can also specify a float
version:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(Interpolator "BSplineInterpolatorFloat")}
\end{quote}
which saves you another bit of memory the size of a short image.
This option is useful for \elastix\ only. To save even more memory,
use the \texttt{LinearInterpolator}.

\item Change the interpolator that is used when resampling an image:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{(ResampleInterpolator "FinalBSplineInterpolatorFloat")}
\end{quote}
This option is useful both for \elastix\ and \transformix. However,
for \elastix\ it will only save you some memory at the very end of
the registration.

\item Use downsampled images during the registration. This probably
will not effect the registration accuracy too much. After
registration you can apply the resulting transformation to the
original full size moving image, using \transformix. See the FAQ for
more information.

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Advanced topics}\label{chp:advanced}

\section{Metrics}

\subsection{Image registration with multiple metrics and/or images}

Up till now we viewed image registration as the problem of finding
the spatial relation between one fixed image and one moving image,
using one similarity metric to define the fit. Sometimes, it is
desirable to combine multiple metrics, or multiple fixed and moving
images, or both. All these three generalisations are available in \elastix:
\begin{description}
\item[multi-metric] In this case the registration cost function is defined
as:
\begin{align}
\CC(\vTm; I_F, I_M) &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \omega_i} \sum_{i=1}^N
\omega_i \CC_i(\vTm; I_F, I_M),
\end{align}
with $\omega_i$ the weights. This way the same fixed and moving
image is used for every sub-metric $\CC_i$. This way one can for
example simultaneously optimise the MSD and MI during a
registration.

\elastix\ should be called like:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{elastix -f fixed.ext -m moving.ext -out outDir -p parameterFile.txt}
\end{quote}

\item[multi-image] In this case the registration cost function is defined
as:
\begin{align}
\CC(\vTm; I_F, I_M) &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \omega_i} \sum_{i=1}^N
\omega_i \CC(\vTm; I_F^i, I_M^i).
\end{align}
This way one can simultaneously register all channels of
multi-spectral input data, using a single type of cost function for
all channels.

\elastix\ should be called like:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{elastix -f0 fixed0.ext -f1 fixed1.ext -f<>... -m0 moving0.ext -m1
moving1.ext -m<>... -out outDir -p parameterFile.txt}
\end{quote}

\item[both] In this case the registration cost function is defined
as:
\begin{align}
\CC(\vTm; I_F, I_M) &= \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^N \omega_i} \sum_{i=1}^N
\omega_i \CC_i(\vTm; I_F^i, I_M^i).
\end{align}
This is the most general way of registration supported by \elastix.
This will make it possible for example to register two lung CT data
sets with MI, while simultaneously registering the fissure
segmentations with the kappa statistic. The two may help each other
in getting a better registration compared to only using a single channel.
\end{description}

All three scenarios use the multi-metric registration method, which
is selected in the parameter file with:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
(Registration "MultiMetricMultiResolutionRegistration")
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize Other parts of the parameter file should look like:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
(FixedImagePyramid "FixedSmoothingImagePyramid" "FixedSmoothingImagePyramid" ...)
(MovingImagePyramid "MovingSmoothingImagePyramid" "MovingSmoothingImagePyramid" ... )
(Interpolator "BSplineInterpolator" "BSplineInterpolator" ...)
(Metric "AdvancedMattesMutualInformation" "AdvancedMeanSquares" ...)
(ImageSampler "RandomCoordinate" "RandomCoordinate" ...)

(Metric0Weight 0.125)
(Metric1Weight 0.125)
(Metric2Weight 0.125)
etc
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Another way of registering multi-spectral data is to use the
$\alpha$-mutual information measure, described below.

\subsection{$\alpha$-mutual information}

The $\alpha$-mutual information metric computes true multi-channel
$\alpha$-mutual information. It does not use high-dimensional joint
histograms, but instead relies on $k$-nearest neighbour graphs to
estimate $\alpha$-MI. Details can be found in \cite{Staring09}. It
is specified in the parameter file with: \small
\begin{verbatim}
(Registration "MultiResolutionRegistrationWithFeatures")
(FixedImagePyramid "FixedSmoothingImagePyramid" "FixedSmoothingImagePyramid")
(MovingImagePyramid "MovingSmoothingImagePyramid" "MovingSmoothingImagePyramid")
(Interpolator "BSplineInterpolator" "BSplineInterpolator")
(Metric "KNNGraphAlphaMutualInformation")
(ImageSampler "MultiInputRandomCoordinate")

// KNN specific
(Alpha 0.99)
(AvoidDivisionBy 0.0000000001)
(TreeType "KDTree")
(BucketSize 50)
(SplittingRule "ANN_KD_STD")
(ShrinkingRule "ANN_BD_SIMPLE")
(TreeSearchType "Standard")
(KNearestNeighbours 20)
(ErrorBound 10.0)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize A complete list of the available parameters can be found in the
doxygen documentation $\rightarrow$ \linebreak
\texttt{elx::KNNGraphAlphaMutualInformationMetric}.

\subsection{Penalty terms}\label{sec:penaltyterms}

This paragraph requires extension and modification.

In order to regularise the transformation $\vT_{\vmu}$ often a
penalty term $\mathcal{P}(\vmu)$ is added to the cost function, so
it becomes:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{C} &= \gamma_1 \mathcal{S} + \gamma_2 \mathcal{P},
\end{align}
where $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ user-defined constants that weigh
similarity against regularity.

Penalty term are often based on the first or second order spatial
derivatives of the transformation. An example is the bending energy
of the transformation, which is arguably the most common penalty
term, see Section \ref{sec:advanced:be}.

The derivative of the similarity measure usually involves
computation of the spatial derivative of the moving image:
$\D{I_M}{\vx}$, and the derivative of the transformation to its
parameters: $\D{\vT}{\vmu}$. In the ITK the last derivative is
implemented using $\texttt{transform->GetJacobian()}$, i.e. the
derivative to the transformation parameters $\vmu$ is referred to as
`Jacobian'.

Penalty terms usually consist of the first and second order
\emph{spatial} derivatives of the transformation, i.e.
$\D{\vT}{\vx}$ and $\Dd{\vT}{\vx}{\vx^T}$. We will refer to these
derivatives as the `SpatialJacobian' and the `SpatialHessian' to
clearly distinguish between these derivatives and the `Jacobian'. In
order to apply the gradient descent optimisation routine
(\ref{eq:gd}), (\ref{eq:RM}), we additionally need the derivatives
$\D{}{\vmu} \D{\vT}{\vx}$ and $\D{}{\vmu} \Dd{\vT}{\vx}{\vx^T}$.
These we call the `JacobianOfSpatialJacobian' and
`JacobianOfSpatialHessian', respectively.

The transform class as defined in the ITK does not support the computation of
spatial derivatives $\partial \vT / \partial \vx$ and $\partial^2 \vT /
\partial \vx^2$, and their derivatives to $\vmu$. Initially, we created
non-generic classes that combine mutual information and the
mentioned penalty terms specifically (the
\texttt{MattesMutualInformationWithRigidityPenalty} component in
\elastix\ version 4.3 and earlier). In 2010, however, we created a
more advanced version of the ITK transform that does implement these
spatial derivatives. Additionally, we created a bending energy
regularisation class that takes advantage of these functions, see
Section \ref{sec:advanced:be}. We also reimplemented the rigidity
penalty term, see Section \ref{sec:advanced:rp}; it currently
however does not yet use these spatial derivatives. More detailed
information can be found in \cite{StaringKlein2010a}.

This all means that it is possible in \elastix\ to combine any similarity
metric with any of the available penalty terms (currently the bending energy
and the rigidity penalty term).

\subsection{Bending energy penalty}\label{sec:advanced:be}

The bending energy penalty term is defined in 2D as:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{BE}}(\vmu) &= \frac{1}{P} \sum_{\vxt[i]}
\left\| \frac{\partial^2 \vT}{\partial \vx \partial \vx^T}(\vxt[i])
\right\|_F^2 \\
&= \frac{1}{P} \sum_{\vxt[i]} \sum_{j = 1}^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2
T_j}{\partial x_1^2}(\vxt[i]) \right)^2  + 2 \left( \frac{\partial^2
T_j}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2}(\vxt[i]) \right)^2 + \left(
\frac{\partial^2 T_j}{\partial x_2^2}(\vxt[i]) \right)^2,
\end{align}
where $P$ is the number of points $\vxt[i]$, and the tilde denotes the
difference between a variable and a given point over which a term is evaluated.
As you can see it penalises sharp deviations of the transformation (e.g. no
high compression followed by a nearby high expansion). You can use it to
regularise your nonrigid transformation if you experience problems such as
foldings. In our current implementation the computation time of this term is
relatively large, though.

It can be selected in \elastix\ using \small
\begin{verbatim}
(Metric "AnySimilarityMetric" "TransformBendingEnergyPenalty")
(Metric0Weight 1.0)
(Metric1Weight <weight>)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize and has no further parameters.

\subsection{Rigidity penalty}\label{sec:advanced:rp}

Some more advanced metrics, not found in the ITK, are available in
\elastix: The rigidity penalty term
$\mathcal{P}^{\mathrm{rigid}}(\vTm;I_M)$ described in
\cite{Staring07}. It is specified in the parameter file with: \small
\begin{verbatim}
(Metric "AnySimilarityMetric" "TransformRigidityPenalty")
// normal similarity metric parameters
...
// Weights
(Metric0Weight 1.0)
(Metric1Weight 0.1)

// Rigidity penalty parameters:
(OrthonormalityConditionWeight 1.0)
(PropernessConditionWeight 100.0)
(MovingRigidityImageName "movingRigidityImage.mhd")
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize A complete list of the available parameters can be found in the
doxygen documentation $\rightarrow$ \linebreak
\texttt{elx::TransformRigidityPenalty}. See also
Section~\ref{sec:penaltyterms}.

\subsection{DisplacementMagnitudePenalty: inverting transformations}

The \texttt{DisplacementMagnitudePenalty} is a cost function that penalises
$||\vTm(\vx)-\vx||^2$. You can use this to invert transforms, by setting the
transform to be inverted as an initial transform (using \texttt{-t0}), setting
\texttt{(HowToCombineTransforms "Compose")}, and running \elastix\ with this
metric, using the original fixed image set both as fixed (\texttt{-f}) and
moving (\texttt{-m}) image. After that you can manually set the initial
transform in the last parameter file to \texttt{"NoInitialTransform"}, and
voila, you have the inverse transform! Strictly speaking, you should then also
change the Size/Spacing/Origin/Index/Direction settings to match that of the
moving image. Select it with: \small
\begin{verbatim}
(Metric "DisplacementMagnitudePenalty")
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize Note that inverting a transformation becomes conceptually very
similar to performing an image registration in this way. Consequently, the same
choices are relevant: optimisation algorithm, multiresolution etc...

Note that this procedure was described and evaluated in \cite{Metz11}.

\subsection{Corresponding points: help the registration}

Most of the similarity measures in \elastix\ are based on corresponding
characteristics of the fixed and moving image. It is possible, however, to
register based on point correspondence. Therefore, in \elastix\ 4.4 we
introduced a metric that minimises the distance of two point sets with known
correspondence. It is defined as:
\begin{align}
\Sim_{\mathrm{CP}} &= \frac{1}{P} \sum_{\vx_{Fi}} \left\| \vx_{Mi} -
\vTm(\vx_{Fi}) \right\|
\end{align}
where $P$ is the number of points $\vx_i$, and $\vx_{Fi}, \vx_{Mi}$
corresponding points from the fixed and moving image point sets, respectively.
The metric can be used to help in a difficult image registration task that
fails if performed fully automatically. A user can manually click corresponding
points (or maybe automatically extract), and setup \elastix\ to not only
minimise based on intensity, but also taking into account that some positions
are known to correspond. The derivative of $\Sim_{\mathrm{CP}}$ reads:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \vmu} \Sim_{\mathrm{CP}} &= -\frac{1}{P}
\sum_{\vx_{Fi}} \frac{1}{\left\| \vx_{Mi} - \vTm(\vx_{Fi})
\right\|} \left( \vx_{Mi} - \vTm(\vx_{Fi}) \right) \frac{\partial
\vT}{\partial \vmu}(\vx_{Fi}).
\end{align}

In \elastix\ this metric can be selected using: \small
\begin{verbatim}
(Metric "AnySimilarityMetric" "CorrespondingPointsEuclideanDistanceMetric")
(Metric0Weight 1.0)
(Metric1Weight <weight>)
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize Note that this metric must be specified as the last
metric, due to some technical constraints. The fixed and moving
point set can be specified on the command line:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{elastix ... -fp fixedPointSet.txt -mp movingPointSet.txt}
\end{quote}
The point set files have to be defined in a specific format,
identical to supplying points to \transformix, see Section
\ref{sec:calltransformix}.

\subsection{VarianceOverLastDimensionMetric: aligning time series}

This metric is explained in \cite{Metz11}. Example parameter files can be found
on the wiki parameter file database, entry \texttt{par0012}.

This metric should be used to estimate the motion in dynamic imaging data (time
series). The variance of intensities over time is measured. Two- to
four-dimensional imaging data is supported.

\section{Image samplers}

\begin{description}
\item[RandomSparseMask] This variant of the random sampler is useful if the
    fixed image mask is sparse (i.e. consists of many zeros).
\end{description}

\section{Interpolators}

\begin{description}
\item[ReducedDimensionBSplineInterpolator] This is a variant of the normal
    B-spline interpolator, which uses a 0$^\text{th}$ order spline in the
    last dimension. This saves time when aligning time-series, when you do
    not have to interpolate in the last (time) dimension anyway. Its usage
    is illustrated in entry \texttt{par0012} of the parameter file
    database.
\end{description}

\section{Transforms}\label{sec:adv:transform}

\begin{description}
\item[DeformationFieldTransform] This transform serves as a wrapper around
    existing deformation field vector images. It computes the
    transformation by interpolating the deformation field image. The
    relevant tags in the transform parameter file are as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
(Transform "DeformationFieldTransform")
(DeformationFieldFileName "deformationField.mhd")
(DeformationFieldInterpolationOrder 1)
(NumberOfParameters 0)
\end{verbatim}
The deformation field image's pixel type should be a vector of
\texttt{float} elements. It could be a deformation field that is the
result of \texttt{transformix -def all} for example! Since this
transform does not have any parameters (the $\vmu$ has zero length),
it makes no sense to use it for registration. It can just be used as
an initial transformation (supplied by the option \texttt{-t0}) or
as input for \transformix.

\item[SplineKernelTransform] As an alternative to the B-spline transform,
\elastix\ includes a \texttt{SplineKernelTransform}, which
implements a thin-plate spline type of transform; see also Section
\ref{sec:comp:transform}. This transformation requires a list of
fixed image landmarks (control points) to be specified with the
command line option ``\texttt{-ipp ipp.txt}'', by means of an input
points file which has the same format as the \texttt{-def} file used
by \transformix\ (see Section~\ref{sec:calltransformix}). See the
\texttt{doxygen} documentation on the website for a list of its
parameters.

The moving image landmarks are optimized during the registration,
and can be found in the resulting \texttt{TransformParameters.txt}
file, in the parameter ``\texttt{TransformParameters}''. See Section
\ref{sec:comp:transform} for the ordering of the parameters.

\item[WeightedCombinationTransform] This is a transformation that is
    modelled as a weighted combination of user-specified transformations:
    $\vTm(\vx) = \sum_i w_i \vT_i(\vx)$. The weights $w_i$ form the
    parameter vector $\vmu$. The sub-transforms $\vT_i(\vx)$ may for
    example follow from a statistical deformation model, obtained by
    principal component analysis. See the \texttt{doxygen} documentation on
    the website for a list of its parameters.

\item[BSplineTransformWithDiffusion] This transform implements the work
    described in \cite{Staring07a}.

\item[BSplineStackTransform] This transformation model defines a stack of
    independent B-spline transformations. Its usage is illustrated in
    \cite{Metz11}. Example parameter files can be found on the wiki
    parameter file database, entry \texttt{par0012}.

\section{Relation to ITK}

%Although \elastix\ is based on the ITK registration framework, it
%implements several functional enhancements.
%
%- AdvancedImageToImageMetric: ImageSampler's, ...
%
%- Advanced transformation, .....

A large part of the \elastix\ code is based on the ITK
\cite{ITKSoftwareGuideSecondEdition}. The use of the ITK implies
that the low-level functionality (image classes, memory allocation
etc.) is thoroughly tested. Naturally, all image formats supported
by the ITK are supported by \elastix\ as well. The C++ source code
can be compiled on multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac
OS X), using various compilers (MS Visual Studio, GCC), and supports
both 32 and 64 bit systems.

In addition to the existing ITK image registration classes,
\elastix\ implements new functionality. The most important
enhancements are listed in Table \ref{table:extras}. Note that from
version 4 ITK also has transform concatenation and supports spatial
derivatives (but not their derivatives to $\vmu$ again).

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{30pc}}
\toprule \toprule
\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1em}
\item A modular framework for sampling strategies. See for more details \cite{StaringKlein2010b}.

\item Several new optimisers: Kiefer-Wolfowitz, Robbins-Monro, adaptive
    stochastic gradient descent, evolutionary strategy. Complete rework
    of existing ITK optimisers, adding more user control and
    better error handling: quasi-Newton, nonlinear conjugate gradient.

\item Several new or more flexible cost functions: (normalised) mutual
    information, implemented with Parzen windowing similar to
    \cite{ThevenazEA00a}, multifeature $\alpha$-mutual information, bending
    energy penalty term, rigidity penalty term.

\item The ability to concatenate any number of geometric transformations.

\item The transformations support computation of not only $\partial \vT /
    \partial \vmu$, but also of spatial derivatives $\partial \vT / \partial
    \vx$ and $\partial^2 \vT / \partial \vx^2$, and their derivatives to
    $\vmu$, frequently required for the computation of regularisation terms.
    Additionally, the compact support of certain transformations is integrated
    more generally. See for more details \cite{StaringKlein2010a}.

\item Linear combinations of cost functions, instead of just a single cost
    function.

%\item A Gaussian pyramid without downsampling.

\section{Overview of the \elastix\ code}

The \elastix\ source code consists roughly of two layers, both
written in C++: A) ITK-style classes that implement image
registration functionality, and B) \elastix\ wrappers that take care
of reading and setting parameters, instantiating and connecting
components, saving (intermediate) results, and similar
`administrative' tasks. The modular design enables adding new
components, without changing the \elastix\ core. Adding a new
component starts by creating the layer A class, which can be
compiled and tested independent of layer B. Subsequently, a small
layer B wrapper needs to be written, which connects the layer A
class to the other parts of \elastix.

The image samplers, for example, are implemented as ITK classes that
all inherit from a base class \texttt{itk::ImageSamplerBase}. These
can be found in \texttt{Common/ImageSamplers}. This is ``layer A''
in \elastix. For each sampler (random, grid, full... ) a wrapper is
written, located in \texttt{Components/ImageSamplers}, which takes
care of configuring the sampler before each new resolution of the
registration process. This is ``layer B'' of \elastix.

\subsection{Directory structure}

The basic directory structure is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item dox
\item Common: ITK classes, Layer A stuff. This directory also contains
    some external libraries, unrelated to ITK, like xout (which is written
    by us) and the ANNlib.
\item Core: this is the main \elastix\ kernel, responsible for the
    execution flow, connecting the classes, reading parameters etc.
\item Components: this directory contains the components and their
    \elastix\ wrappers (layer B). Very component-specific layer A code can
    also be found here.
\end{itemize}

In \elastix\ 4.4 and later versions, it is also possible to add your own
Component directories. These can be located anywhere outside the \elastix\
source tree. See Section \ref{sec:dev:newcomp} for more details about this.

\section{Using \elastix\ in your own software}

There are (at least) three ways to use \elastix\ in your own
software:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compile the \elastix\ executable and directly call it with the
appropriate arguments. This is the most easy way, and Matlab and
MeVisLab code exists for that.

\item Include the \elastix\ source code in your own project, see
Section \ref{ssec:dev:include}.

\item Compile \elastix\ as a library and link to it, see
Section \ref{ssec:dev:library}. This functionality is available as
of version 4.7 (February 2014).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Including \elastix\ code in your own software}\label{ssec:dev:include}

You may find some \elastix\ classes useful to integrate in your own
project. For example, if you are developing a new \elastix\
component and first would like to test it outside \elastix\ (see
Section \ref{sec:dev:newcomp}. In such a case, you could of course
copy the required \elastix\ files to your own project, or set the
include-paths manually, but this would not be very convenient.

To make it easier, a \texttt{UseElastix.cmake} file is generated in the
\elastix\ binary directory. You can include this in the \texttt{CMakeLists.txt}
file of your own project, and CMake will make sure that all necessary
include\_directories are set. Also, you can link to the \elastix\ libraries,
such as elxCommon, to avoid recompiling code.

An example of this can be found in the directory
\texttt{dox/externalproject} of the \elastix\ source distribution.

\subsection{Using \elastix\ as a library}\label{ssec:dev:library}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

\elastix\ also offers the possibility to be used as dynamic or
static linked library. This offers the possibility to integrate its
functionality in your own software, without having to call the
external \elastix\ executable. The latter namely has the downside
that your software, which presumably already has the fixed and
moving images in memory, has to store these images to disk.
\elastix\ will then load them again (so they will be in memory
twice), perform the registration, and write the result to disk. Your
software then needs to load the result from the disk to memory. This
approach obviously leads to an increase in memory use, decrease in
performance due to the reading/writing overhead, and is just not
very elegant. When using \elastix\ as a library your software only
has to pass memory pointers to the library interface, so there is no
need for reading/writing or in-memory image duplication. After
registration \elastix\ will pass a pointer to the resulting image
back to your program.

Library functionality is still quite heavily under development, but
the following basic functionality is already available:
\begin{itemize}
\item Registration of any pair of images using any combination of
\elastix\ components.

\item Usage of registration masks.

\item Usage of multiple parameter files consecutively (similar to
using the -p option of the \elastix\ executable multiple times).

\item Using \transformix\ to transform an image.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Building \elastix\ as a static or dynamic library}

To build \elastix\ as a library you have to disable the
\texttt{ELASTIX\_BUILD\_EXECUTABLE} option in CMake. With this
option disabled a build project for a static library will be
created. Note that \elastix\ cannot be built as a dynamic library:
The CMake option \texttt{BUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS} should be \texttt{OFF},
when building \elastix.

\subsubsection{Linking with the \elastix\ library}

When building your own software project, you need to link \elastix\
and provide the \elastix\ source directory as an include directory
to your compiler. You can do this, for example, by adding the
following code to your CMakeLists.txt file:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
set( ELASTIX_BUILD_DIR "" CACHE PATH "Path to elastix build folder" )
set( ELASTIX_USE_FILE ${ELASTIX_BUILD_DIR}/UseElastix.cmake )

if( EXISTS ${ELASTIX_USE_FILE} )
  include( ${ELASTIX_USE_FILE} )
  link_libraries( param )
  link_libraries( elastix )
  link_libraries( transformix )
endif()
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This will add a parameter to CMake, \texttt{ELASTIX\_BUILD\_DIR},
which needs to be provided by the user upon running CMake. You
should provide the directory in which you have build the \elastix\
sources (the directory having the \texttt{UseElastix.cmake} file).
If you want to control better to which binaries you link \elastix,
use the CMake \texttt{target\_link\_libraries} directive instead.


\subsubsection{Preparing registration parameter settings}

To be able to run \elastix, you need to prepare the parameter
settings first. You can do this for example by reading them from
file:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
#include "elastixlib.h"
#include "itkParameterFileParser.h"

using namespace elastix;
typedef ELASTIX::ParameterMapType RegistrationParametersType;
typedef itk::ParameterFileParser  ParserType;

// Create parser for transform parameters text file.
ParserType::Pointer file_parser = ParserType::New();

// Try parsing transform parameters text file.
file_parser->SetParameterFileName( "par_registration.txt" );
try
{
  file_parser->ReadParameterFile();
}
catch( itk::ExceptionObject & e )
{
  std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
  // Do some error handling!
}

// Retrieve parameter settings as map.
RegistrationParametersType parameters = file_parser->GetParameterMap();
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

If you want to use multiple parameter files consecutively, load them
one by one and add them to a vector:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef std::vector<RegistrationParametersType> RegistrationParametersContainerType;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
Then use this vector in the code below instead of the single
parameter map. You can also set up the parameter map in your C++
code. Check the typedef of \texttt{ELASTIX::ParameterMapType} for
the exact format.

\subsubsection{Running \elastix}

Once the parameter settings are loaded, run \elastix\ using, for
example, the following code:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ELASTIX elastix;
int error = 0;
try
{
  error = elastix.RegisterImages(
    static_cast<typename itk::DataObject::Pointer>( fixed_image.GetPointer() ),
    static_cast<typename itk::DataObject::Pointer>( moving_image.GetPointer() ),
    parameters,        // Parameter map read in previous code
    output_directory,  // Directory where output is written, if enabled
    write_log_file,    // Enable/disable writing of elastix.log
    output_to_console, // Enable/disable output to console
    nullptr,           // Provide fixed image mask (optional, nullptr = no mask)
    nullptr            // Provide moving image mask (optional, nullptr = no mask)
  );
}
catch( itk::ExceptionObject &err )
{
  // Do some error handling.
}

if( error == 0 )
{
  if( elastix->GetResultImage().IsNotNull() )
  {
    // Typedef the ITKImageType first...
    ITKImageType * output_image = static_cast<ITKImageType *>(
      elastix.GetResultImage().GetPointer());
  }
}
else
{
  // Registration failure. Do some error handling.
}

// Get transform parameters of all registration steps.
RegistrationParametersContainerType transform_parameters
  = elastix.GetTransformParameterMapList();
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Running transformix}

Given the transformation parameters provided by the \texttt{ELASTIX}
class, you can run \transformix:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
TRANSFORMIX transformix;
int error = 0;
try
{
  error = transformix.TransformImage(
    static_cast<typename itk::DataObject::Pointer>(input_image_adapter.GetPointer()),
    transform_parameters, // Parameters resulting from elastix run
    output_path,
    write_log_file,       // Enable/disable writing of transformix.log
    output_to_console);   // Enable/disable output to console
}
catch( itk::ExceptionObject &err )
{
  // Do some error handling.
}

if( error == 0 )
{
  // Typedef the ITKImageType first...
  ITKImageType * output_image = static_cast<ITKImageType *>(
    transformix.GetResultImage().GetPointer());
}
else
{
  // Do some error handling.
}

\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
Alternatively, you can read the transformation parameters from file
(for example, from \texttt{TransformParameters.0.txt}) using the
parameter file parser in the same way as was shown for the
registration parameters above.

\section{Creating new components}\label{sec:dev:newcomp}

If you want to create your own component, it is natural to start writing the
layer A class, without bothering about \elastix. The layer A filter should
implement all basic functionality and you can test in a separate ITK program if
it does what it is supposed to do. Once you got this ITK class to work, it is
trivial to write the layer B wrapper in \elastix\ (start by copy-pasting from
existing components).

With CMake, you can tell \elastix\ in which directories the source code of your
new components is located, using the \texttt{ELASTIX\_USER\_COMPONENT\_DIRS}
option. \elastix\ will search all subdirectories of these directories for
CMakeLists.txt files that contain the command \texttt{ADD\_ELXCOMPONENT( <name>
... )}. The CMakeLists.txt file that accompanies an \elastix\ component looks
typically like this:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ADD_ELXCOMPONENT( AdvancedMeanSquaresMetric
  elxAdvancedMeanSquaresMetric.h
  elxAdvancedMeanSquaresMetric.hxx
  elxAdvancedMeanSquaresMetric.cxx
  itkAdvancedMeanSquaresImageToImageMetric.h
  itkAdvancedMeanSquaresImageToImageMetric.hxx )
 \end{verbatim}
 \end{quote}
The \texttt{ADD\_ELXCOMPONENT} command is a macro defined in
\texttt{Components/CMakeLists.txt}. The first argument is the name
of the layer B wrapper class, which is declared in
``elxAdvancedMeanSquaresMetric.h''. After that, you can specify the
source files on which the component relies. In the example above,
the files that start with ``itk'' form the layer A code. Files that
start with ``elx'' are the layer B code. The file
``elxAdvancedMeanSquaresMetric.cxx'' is particularly simple. It just
consists of two lines:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
#include "elxAdvancedMeanSquaresMetric.h"
elxInstallMacro( AdvancedMeanSquaresMetric );
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The \texttt{elxInstallMacro} is defined in
\texttt{Core/Install/elxMacro.h}.

The files \texttt{elxAdvancedMeanSquaresMetric.h/hxx} together define the layer
B wrapper class. That class inherits from the corresponding layer A class, but
also from an \texttt{elx::BaseComponent}. This gives us the opportunity to add
a common interface to all elastix components, regardless of the ITK classes
from which they inherit. Examples of this interface are the following methods:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
  void BeforeAll(void)
  void BeforeRegistration(void)
  void BeforeEachResolution(void)
  void AfterEachResolution(void)
  void AfterEachIteration(void)
  void AfterRegistration(void)
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
These methods are automatically invoked at the moments indicated by the name of
the function. This gives you a chance to read/set some parameters, print some
output, save some results etc.


\section{Coding style}\label{sec:dev:style}

In order to improve code readability and consistency, which has a
positive influence on maintainability we have adopted a coding
style. A rough \texttt{uncrustify} configuration file is provided in
\elastix\ since version 4.7.

\begin{description}
\item[White spacing] Good spacing improves code readability. Therefore,

\begin{itemize}
\item Don't use tabs. Tabs depend on tab size, which will make the
code appearance dependent on the viewer. We use 2 spaces per tab. In
Visual Studio this can be set as a preference: go to tools
$\rightarrow$ options $\rightarrow$ text editor $\rightarrow$ All
languages $\rightarrow$ Tabs, then tab size = indent size = 2 and
mark ``insert spaces''. In vim you can adapt your \texttt{.vimrc} to include
the lines \texttt{set ts=2; set sw=2; set expandtab}.

\item No spaces at the end of a line, like in ITK. It's just ugly. To
make them (very) noticeable add the following in your \texttt{.vimrc}:
\begin{verbatim}
  :highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red
  :match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
\end{verbatim}

\item Use spaces in functions, \texttt{for} loops, indices, etc. So,
\begin{verbatim}
  FunctionName(.void.);
  for(.i.=.0;.i.<.10;.++i.)
  vector[.i.].=.3;
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\item[Indentation] l

\begin{itemize}
\item Not too much, not too long lines
\begin{verbatim}
namespace itk
{
^
^
/**
.* ********************* Function ******************************
.*/
^
template <class TTemplate1, class TTemplate2>
void
ClassName<TTemplate1, TTemplate2>
::Function(.void.)
{
..//Function body
..this->OtherMemberFunction(.arguments.);
..for(.i.=.0;.i.<.10;.++i.)
..{
....x.+=.i.*.i;
..}
^
} // end Function()
^
}.//.end.namespace.itk
\end{verbatim}

\item A class looks like
\begin{verbatim}
namespace itk
{
^
/**.\class.ClassName
.*.\brief.Brief.description
.*
.*.Detailed.description
.*
.*.\ingroup.Group
.*/
^
template < templateArguments >
class.ClassName:
public.SuperclassName
{
public:
^
../**.Standard.class.typedefs..*/
..typedef.ClassName..................Self;
..typedef.SuperclassName.............Superclass;
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\item[Variable and function naming] It's nice if from the name of a variable you know
that it's local or a class member. Therefore,

\begin{itemize}
\item Member variables are prepended with \texttt{m\_}, followed by
a capital. In the implementation refer to them using
\verb|this->|. So, \verb|this->m_MemberVariable| is correct.

\item Local variables should start with a lower case character.

\item Functions should start with a capital.

\item Member functions should also be called using \texttt{this->}
\end{itemize}

\item[Better code] Some simple things to look at:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use const wherever you can

\item For floats don't use 0, but 0.0 to avoid possible bugs.

\item Use the virtual keyword when overriding a virtual function in a derived
class. This is not strictly needed in C++, but when you use it, it is immediately
clear that a function overridden or meant to be overridden.

\item Always use opening and closing brackets. Although it is not always needed for C++, do
\begin{verbatim}
  if(.condition.)
  {
  ..valid = true;
  }
\end{verbatim}
instead of
\begin{verbatim}
  if(.condition.)
  ..valid = true;
\end{verbatim}
Also for \texttt{for}-loops.
\end{itemize}

\item[Commenting] Code is meant to be read by others, or by you in years time. So,

\begin{itemize}
\item Comment a lot

\item End functions with \verb|} // end FunctionName()|
\end{itemize}

%not too long lines,
%Dit is voor de leesbaarheid en om niet alles teveel naar rechts te
%indenten. Ook handig voor niet zo brede schermen.
%
%
%- 1 witregel aan het eind van een file. Die ene is nodig voor
%sommige oude compilers, en meer is niet nodig.

\chapter{Practical exercise: using VV with \elastix}\label{chp:vvtutorial}

\textbf{This exercise has been kindly provided by Simon Rit (Creatis).}

The goal of these practical exercises is to introduce you to the problem of
image registration. Because software development is time consuming, you will
not develop your own software but use existing open-source programs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \elastix\ (\url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/}, [1]) is an open-source
    platform for automated image registration based on the Insight
    Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (\url{www.itk.org}). The
    development was initiated by the Image Sciences Institute of the
    University Medical Center of Utrecht (The Netherlands). It is command
    line driven with configuration settings defined in a parameter file.
    The user manual is available here:
    \url{http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/download/elastix_manual_v4.5.pdf}.
\item vv (\url{http://vv.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/}), [2]) is an open-source
    and cross platform image viewer, designed for fast and simple
    visualization, based on ITK and the Visualization Toolkit
    (\url{www.vtk.org}). The development was initiated by the CREATIS
    laboratory of Lyon (France). It can also be command line driven.
    Command line options are accessible with \verb+vv --help+, key
    shortcuts with \verb+F1+.
\end{itemize}

To run a command window in Windows, click on \verb+Executer+ in the Windows
menu and type \verb+cmd+. In this window, you can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Change drive by typing, e.g., \verb+D:+ to go to drive D.
    \item Change folder by typing, e.g., \verb+cd tmp+ to go to subfolder
\textit{tmp}.
    \item Create a directory by typing, e.g., \verb+mkdir toto+ to create a
\textit{toto} subfolder.
\end{itemize}

At the end of the exercises, you should be able to do rigid (manual and
automated) as well as non-rigid registrations and to visualize the results. You
will write a report to answer the instructions with a bold font which will
contain concise comments supported with screenshots whenever possible.

\section{Manual rigid registration}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Download the images \textit{ct.mha} and \textit{cbct.mha}:
     \url{http://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/~srit/tete}.
 \item Open them in vv with the command line \verb+vv ct.mha cbct.mha+.
     Observe them, change image on each slicer and analyze the effect of
     each shortcut and mouse option in the help menu (\verb+F1+).
 \item Open them in vv with the command line %
  \verb+vv --linkall ct.mha cbct.mha+ and observe the difference.
 \item Open them in vv with the command line %
  \verb+vv ct.mha --overlay cbct.mha+ and observe the difference.
 \item In the menu \verb+Tools+, open the manual registration tool and play
     with the sliders. Check that the behavior of vv manual registration is
     consistent with that described in the \elastix\ manual, section 2.6.
 \item \textbf{Manually register the two images.}
 \item \textbf{Knowing that the convention is Euler angles with YXZ,
     explain how the resulting matrix is computed from the parameters.}
 \item The software is not robust to the gimbal lock. \textbf{Explain for
     which parameter(s) the gimbal lock is reached and observe the
     consequence in vv.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Automated rigid registration}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Download the \elastix\ parameter file \textit{Par0005.MI.rigid.txt}
     which has been taken from the \elastix\ database on their website.
 \item Create a \textit{rigid} directory with \verb+mkdir rigid+ and run \elastix\ with the command
 line \\
 \verb+elastix -f cbct.mha -m ct.mha -p Par0005.MI.rigid.txt -out rigid+\\
 \textbf{Observe the result with vv by typing the result parameters in the
 manual registration window (in the file
 \textit{rigid/TransformParameters.0.txt}).}
 \item \textbf{Detect a not so well aligned region and elaborate on the
     cause.}
 \item \textbf{Compare 3 similarity measures and plot their evolution
     during optimization.}
\end{itemize}

%\section{Local rigid registration}
%\begin{itemize}
% \item In vv, open the fixed image \verb+Tools+ / \verb+Crop+, and crop a small region which was not well aligned.
% \item \textbf{Rerun the registration and comment on the alignment result for this region as well as the rest of the image.}
%\end{itemize}

\section{Non-rigid registration}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Download the pre-registered image \textit{ct.mhd} and check that
     only deformations are left with\\\verb+vv ct.mhd --overlay cbct.mha+.
 \item Download the \elastix\ parameter file \textit{Par0005.MI.1.txt}. The
     latter has been modified to account for the embedded rigid
     registration with the parameter\\\verb+(UseDirectionCosines "true")+.
 \item Create a \textit{dir} directory with \verb+mkdir dir+ and
     run\\\verb+elastix -f cbct.mha -m ct.mhd -p Par0005.MI.1.txt -out dir+
 \item Create a \textit{dirres} directory with \verb+mkdir dirres+ and
     run\\\verb+transformix -in ct.mhd -out dirres -tp dir/TransformParameters.0.R1.txt -def all+ %
 \item \textbf{Discuss the results using the two commands:}\\
 \verb+vv cbct.mha --vf dirres/deformationField.mhd+\\
 \verb+vv --linkall cbct.mha --overlay ct.mhd cbct.mha --overlay dirres/result.mhd+ %

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
